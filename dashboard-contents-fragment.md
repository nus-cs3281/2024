Linter prevents me from adding type annotations to member fields that are initialized. Error: no-inferrable-types.
The initial values used are also what I deem proper as initially the tables are not sorted at all, internally matsort is initialised with an empty string which is what I am emulating here.

In this case wouldn't I still need these two functions to update the TableSettings in the service.
I am not sure of the benefit of the observable implementation since the only things listening and emitting these changes is from the tables component.

``FiltersService::previousMilestonesLength`` serves the purpose of determining whether all milestones were selected from the previous repo when saved to the new one.
This case should be handled since if the user did not deliberately select specific milestone filters, we should not deliberately select certain milestones in the new repo when filters are kept.
An example of the behaviour I am avoiding by handling this case is as follows:
1. All milestones selected, user did not change or even notice milestone filters
![image](https://github.com/CATcher-org/WATcher/assets/88131400/49132ea8-b007-4de2-abf8-6a7308ba7295)
2. Keep filters to new repo with no matching milestones
![image](https://github.com/CATcher-org/WATcher/assets/88131400/2eb1fef5-a602-49c0-a678-86cbf07c42c4)
3. Without a milestone is exclusively selected since its title matches previous repo selection. User expects all milestones to be selected since he did not adjust milestone filters
![image](https://github.com/CATcher-org/WATcher/assets/88131400/48301ec9-659a-4dca-be49-0e28177da294)

With previousMilestonesLength and the case of all milestones selected handled, step 3 correctly shows all milestones of the new repo being selected. 
The correct behaviour is the current implementation of this PR.

In my opinion, since the ``filter`` (previously ``dropdownFilter``) variable now represents all the filters instead of only the dropdown filters, they should be named appropriately for consistency.
Is there a reason we shouldn't change the names?

> Since one potential use case of WATcher is for CS2103T students, and CS2103T projects have the same milestones, should we keep the milestone filters as well?

I agree. As mentioned in the pull request description, currently milestones are saved via index instead of via name. Therefore saving milestones without refactoring them first will mean saving their relative order. 
For instance, saving the first milestone of repo A when changing to repo B means the first milestone of repo B will be selected. 
The intended behaviour would be the milestone with the corresponding name in repo B being selected.

As such, I plan to refactor the milestones to be saved via name and implement saving the milestones in a separate pull request

An alternative implementation to renaming the dropdown filters would be to keep the dropdown filter object separate from the title filter as before.
However I do not see the benefit in doing this segregation.
On the other hand, such an implementation would contribute to additional functions and another behavior subject in the filters service which don't do anything different from the one for dropdown filters.

> Feedback - this solution is one possible way to manipulate the visibility of the Card view component. Kudos to thinking in terms of hiding per card view component using css properties so that the filters will work. However it is better practice to hide the elements in the html file instead, and accessing the length and isLoading variables via the html file.
> 
> PR title and commit message looks ok.

I have shifted logic to the html for the issues viewer component. Uses isLoading and issueLength properties of card view applied to its css display property.

The reason for changing ``labelsSubject'' from type ''BehaviourSubject'' to ''Subject'' is because ''BehaviourSubject'' emits an initial empty array as the all labels array. 
As a result, when opening a repo through a url with some specified labels in the url, those labels are sanitized immediately because of the initial emission of the empty all labels.
The change to ''Subject'' removes this initial empty labels emission, solving the issue.

> Please update your branch. We are no longer using `_validateFilters` in filters service.
> 
> Some preliminary comments on the filter:
> 
> * It does not work when I paste a URL containing the filters with milestones into the browser. It defaults back to selecting all milestones.
> * Filters with one-value can be made more readable by removing the quotation marks around. For e.g. filter by type can be encoded as `type=issue` instead of `type="issue"`

This PR was created before milestones were saved hence the behaviour. 
I agree with the encoding behaviour suggested and would also like to use the same method of subscribing to pop state events precedented in #319.
Will update this PR with the appropriate behaviour once changes to FiltersService are finalised in the pending PRs.

> Besides, pressing the "Currently active" button from the preset view dropdown should change sort property back to "Status", but currently, sort property does not change accordingly.

It was my understanding that changing the sort does not change the preset view to custom, similar to how changing the title filter does not change the preset view to custom. It then follows that changing the preset view to currentlyActive does not change the sort to a default value since changing the sort does not change the preset view status.

It is possible to specify different behaviour for filters effect on preset view and preset views effect on filter. However, I am of the opinion that either preset view should be changed when changing sort and selecting a currentlyActive preset defaults to a status sort, or preset view remains the same when changing sort and selecting a currentlyActive preset does not affect the current sort property.

Changes have been made to specify 2-way binding for sort filter and preset view and 1 way binding for title, itemsPerPage filters and preset view.
To elaborate, when changing sort filters, preset view is changed to custom. When selecting preset view, a default sort is applied.
When changing title or itemsPerPage filters, preset view is not changed to custom. When selecting preset view, a default title and itemsPerPage is applied.

It is named initial because this search filter variable is not updated at all when the user types. Instead this variable is simply used to initialize what is seen by the user at the search bar when they first open a new repo.

I have refactored the code into its own file called FiltersStore.ts and am using a static class to store the filters as they are edited, initialize new repos with previous filter values and clearing the store if filters are not kept.
Current status is that functionality for search, status, type and sort filters are working; Also fixed an oversight that ascending and descending order of sort was not accounted for.
Before I start work on the labels, I would appreciate some feedback on the direction I have taken and if necessary a suggestion for a better, alternative approach.

In hindsight, I think a better approach for consistency would be to have my FiltersStore.ts be the central home of the filters such that all components update and retrieve from FiltersStore. This would negate me having to copy filter changes and will be more developer friendly to understand. What do you think?

I have updated functionality to include the working logic for storing the status, type, sort, search bar, selected labels and hidden labels when the keep filters option is checked when switching repos. I also encountered a small bug where the DEFAULT_DROPDOWN_FILTER milestones property was being added to when switching repos since the array containing the milestones was passed by reference. My most recent push also fixes this issue.

In my opinion I get where @luminousleek is coming from. Default should indicate its default state in the name following the word DEFAULT.
However, this is confusing since developers might mistake it as representing a boolean variable which means "No private repo access", when really it is used as "has private repo access".
I think a better name would be just HAS_PERMISSION_TO_PRIVATE_REPOS. why the DEFAULT at all when it is implied already by static readonly.

As an add-on unrelated to the code but more so the design. 
I feel that the harsh border colors clash with the design of watcher.
To me, a more fitting way of showing the states would be changing the background color of the entire label to a light red/pink for deselected and light green for selected.

This is because in ``label-filter-bar.component.ts::removeAllSelection`` references ``matSelectionList`` which no longer exists. 
The button functionality is therefore completely disabled.
Please refactor this function in accordance with the new implementation.

While this accomplishes the same thing as before, my opinion is that it is clearer with the previous implementation. 
To elaborate, the reasoning behind the subscription is clearer since we are using the emitted value.

Is it necessary to include a statusToType sort of function in the filters service? 
The filters service should be exclusively kept for storing and updating filters in line with the SRP.
I think this characterization of information from certain filters should be done where the filters are applied i.e., in dropdownfilter.ts in this case.
I would suggest simply using the status string in dropdownfilter.ts and parsing it appropriately as part of filtering

The naming of these functions could be made clearer. As they are they imply updating the group and removing the group but is unclear what the update is or what the removal is from.

An excellent PR which lays the groundwork for switching by group. Perhaps the currGroupBy variable could be stored and updated as a filter since I would consider it a filter variable. This would reduce duplicated code for enhancements regarding filters such as storing filters in the url. I will create an issue for discussion not to be implemented in this PR.

Also a minor complaint about naming, but otherwise a great implementation which no doubt took a lot of work! 😀

Since we already have a ``ViewService::setupFromURL`` function that is only called when a user loads into WATcher via url, why not trigger initialize from URL there?
To keep the url loading functionality in the same place, I think the function should be called there instead of subscribing to the popStateEvent. 
This will also mean we don't arbitrarily load from URL the same groupBy that is already in grouping context whenever we route, instead only loading from URL on initial setup.

Is there a necessity for specifying replaceURL for group by?
In my opinion, it is unnatural for me to be changing back to prior group by if I press the previous page button on my browser, I would instead expect to go to a previous page.
It is a matter of UX and should be discussed further, if others agree then we should always set replaceURL to true and remove this parameter to prevent polluting the user history with unintuitive routes specifying different group bys.

Since changing labels, hiddenLabels, deselectedLabels, sort and title do not make the preset view "custom", should we reset them or set them to a fixed value when setting the preset view?
To me, it is unintuitive that since it is "not part of the preset views" since changing these parameters did not affect the status of my preset view being put into custom, choosing a preset view should not reset these parameters.

Your reasoning is sound. I am inclined to agree but still think there may be some confusion.
When I was testing it, I found it strange that my preset views were maintained when i did something like search by title yet my title was reset when i chose a preset view.
Perhaps a new feature could encompass making a (edited) status for the current preset view when these filters are changed while remaining in the preset view.
However, this would be in a separate PR, I have no issue with the current implementation thank you for clarifying your thought process.

</div>

%%[created at: 2024 Feb 08 17:41:22]%%

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
It is frustrating that the filters are declared in multiple components and observables are prop drilled into other components in order to make things work. As a developer working on the filters, it is very difficult to follow.
For example, labelFilter BehaviourSubject is delared in filter-bar, and prop drilled into label-filter-bar.
label-filter-bar is then the component that initializes the labels, calling .next on the behaviour subject from filter-bar.

Additionally, certain filters are referenced objects such as labels being an array and hidden labels being a set. We also use a DEFAULT_DROPDOWN_FILTER variable as the base for when filters are reset. 
Because of these referenced filters, an easy mistake for developers would be these objects' mutation by components, resulting in a permanent mutation of the base DEFAULT_DROPDOWN_FILTER.

This follows from the solution for #205, intended to be worked on after that PR, #226, is merged in.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
A new service filters.service.ts that contains the current repo filters stored as observables and subscribed to the relevant github services such as labelService subscription.
Filters are encapsulated within this component.
Components use the observable's .next and .subscribe functions to access and modify filters

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
We can leave the filters as is and risk errors down the line due to the issues mentioned.
We can use a context provider to lift the state out instead of using a filters service.

</div>

%%[created at: 2024 Mar 03 14:19:19]%%

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Whenever a release is made, changelogs have to be manually typed.
This makes the changelogs prone to developer errors.
Developers also have to spend time looking through potentially many merged PRs and updating changelogs 1 by 1.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
An automated workflow that uses the merged PRs to generate template changelogs.
Possible solutions:
- Use a ready-made github bot: [https://probot.github.io/apps/release-drafter/](https://probot.github.io/apps/release-drafter/)
- Making a custom bot: [https://github.com/probot/probot](https://github.com/probot/probot)

Refer to the issue in CATcher: [https://github.com/CATcher-org/CATcher/issues/639](https://github.com/CATcher-org/CATcher/issues/639)
This solution using the release-drafter bot is already implemented in CATcher, it would make sense to have it in WATcher as well.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Keeping the workflow as is now and commit to spending time writing changelogs on every release

</div>

%%[created at: 2024 Mar 08 19:24:58]%%

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Milestones are saved by index (as string) in the filters service. 
Additionally, the functionality of filtering by milestones uses the index of the milestone to check if any issue or pr is tied to it.
Following #205, milestones saved by index creates issues when saving filters across repo changes.
As an example, if you selected the first milestone of repo A, then saved your filters when changing to repo B, you will find that the first milestone of repo B has been selected regardless of whether they were named the same.
Until this issue is resolved #205 should remain on hold.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Refactor the milestone saving behavior in the filters service to reflect milestone names instead of index
Adjust the filtering by milestone to use the names instead of index

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Leaving saving milestones by index and creating a separate store which houses the names of the milestones selected when pursuing #205.
This creates unnecessary storage when both properties of the filter would refer to the same thing.

**Describe the bug**
One test case in label filter bar component tests describe the filter behaviour subject of filters service as undefined after the latest changes to filters service, keeping filters

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. Go to label-filter-bar.component.spec.ts
2. Uncomment the test ``it (should update all labels with latest emitted value after ngAfterViewInit)``
3. Run npm run test
4. See error of undefined value

**Expected behavior**
Filter$ in filters service should always be defined since it is given an initial value and is never overwritten.
There are no errors in full build

The filters in the URL contain "" for string filters when they are unecessary and unintuitive if users type their own filters in the URL.

We could leave the current behaviour with the quotations as it is unlikely users will be typing their own filters.

Is there a reason we don't simply disable the sources of changes while waiting for github's response? While it might reduce the speed at which someone submits their issues, I argue it is better than the rolling back of their changes.

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Angular 11.2.14 is still outdated, and in line with the idea of keeping CATcher and WATcher at par, CATcher is now updated to Angular 12.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Upgrade of Angular and its dependencies for WATcher to version 12.

%%[created at: 2024 Apr 10 23:34:10]%%

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Currently, each card view has its own dropdown to select items per page. However, it is counterintuitive to have one column showing a different number of items on the page, as compared to another.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Move the `Items per page` dropdown into the filter bar so that it is commonly controlled for all card views.

**Describe the alternative you've considered**
To have the `Items per page` as a separate dropdown elsewhere on the page (for instance, on the bottom right), and implemented separately from the rest of the filters. However, to maintain uniformity of implementation, it is a part of the filter-bar

%%[created at: 2024 Apr 11 23:11:46]%%

Currently, the filter bar is cramped and it is not extensible - addition of new filters requires a significant rearrangement of the layout of the filter bar.

### Alternatives considered

- Making the filters collapsible (only some of the filters will be visible by default, the rest can be expanded and collapsed on demand)
- Making a sliding window for the filters
- Making a dropdown for the filters itself - whichever filter the user chooses from the dropdown shows to the side of this dropdown and can be tweaked

While it is reasonable to separate the option, I believe it can also be achieved by selecting either PRs or Issues under `Type` and then selecting`Without a milestone` to get the desired result.

I'm not sure about this. Since the grouping strategy is a service, shouldn't the interface also be under the service folder?

Thanks for the check. In my opinion, I believe the method createPhaseBugReportingIssues is actually relevant to another concept, "Bug Report," inherited from CATcher, which is not used in WATcher. I think it would be more suitable to remove "Bug Report" in a separate PR.

> Actually this PR could have been broken down further into 2 PRs: one for the Login component and one for the Session model. In fact I'll probably encourage you to break down the second part of your test refactoring PR to 4 separate PRs: one for each spec you're refactoring - makes our job as reviewers easier (since we can review 1 spec at a time without having to review all 4) and also means that reviews will be faster.

ok got it. I will break down the second part later. Thanks for the review, will do the changes soon.

In my opinion, the ViewService is responsible for handling the current view and current repository. I don't think it would be suitable to set up the grouping service within the ViewService. What if we have a view that doesn't utilize the grouping service?

The reason for subscribing to the popStateEvent is to ensure that when navigating back to the previous issue viewer page, we update our grouping service with the "group by" parameter from the previous page. One scenario is that I set the "group by" value to "Milestone" for the current repository, then I switch to another repository without maintaining the filter. When I click the back button, I should expect to return to the previous repository with the previous "group by" and filters.

Some clarifications for the new commits:

1. Now call the `reset` method of `GroupingContextService` after navigating to a new repo. This ensures that the `reset` method won't replace the `groupby` params of the previous repo.
2. Fixed some bugs caused by `Subscription` and `Timeout`. In progress Timeout should be cleared and Subscription should be unsubscribed in `onDestroy` to avoid memory leaks and prevent unexpected behavior."

I'm not sure if there's any benefit to write test cases for the constant provider service. If test cases fail due to future changes in constant values, developers will likely just edit the test cases, resulting in duplicated changes. Also, I think that integration tests for services using these constants should suffice to catch any errors in those constant values.
@CATcher-org/2324s2  what do yall think?

Consider using Jasmine's `done()` callback at the end of the assertions. This is to ensure that the test doesn't complete before the value is emitted, which would lead to the assertions not being executed by Jasmine.

In current implementation, seems like the preset view only include preset value for filters. What if we need preset view with different grouping in the future? Should we include groupby value in the preset value?

I just tried to directly edit the link. It seems like it will also redirect to the login page for a valid route. I think this might be because this action causes the website to reload, and the `isAuthenticated` state is lost. My idea is that we might want to use JWT for authentication, so every time the website reloads, it will check whether the stored JWT is valid instead of resetting the `isAuthenticated` state. What do you all think?

#### Proposal:
I suggest implementing a GroupBy feature to allow users to choose how issues and PRs are grouped, enabling them to categorize data based on various criteria such as milestone, status, and more.

I think it is a very good idea to have some preset views. To improve the flexibility of the view, we can implement the 'groupby' feature, which allows users to configure how columns are organized.

Some useful preset view and brief implementation:
'Active Pull Request': group by 'Assignee', status (open), type (pr)
'Active Issues': group by 'Assignee', filter by milestone (open milestone), status (open), type (issue)
'My Contribution': group by 'Milestone' and filter by assignee (assigned to current user).

Actually I realised that ngx-markdown documentation was actually outdated/incorrect. Also, GFMD was already enabled in CATcher, so right now the current ngx-markdown version is sufficient. We probably can explore upgrading ngx-markdown version when we upgrade the packages/angular/node version.

Thanks @cheehongw for spotting the bug! Can I check the state of the repo when the error occurred, in particular,

1. Is the repo empty or does it already have some images?
2. If it already has some images, what is the default branch of the repo?

I can only reproduce the error when the repo already has some images, and the default branch of the repo is not `main`. When the repo is empty, even if your default branch in your Github settings is not `main`, the file uploaded will be in `main` branch.

I have considered the following solutions:

1. Create the `main` branch upon repo creation.

Note that we cannot create a new branch in an empty repository, because [branches are only pointers to commits](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell#_create_new_branch), we would have to create a commit in order to create the branch.

Octokit allows us to [create commit](https://octokit.github.io/rest.js/v16#git-create-commit), but from the documentation, it does not look like we can indicate the branch upon creating the commit.

Octokit has the option `auto_init` upon [repo creation](https://octokit.github.io/rest.js/v16#repos-create-for-authenticated-user), however, it looks like we cannot indicate the branch for the initial commit.

Another approach is to upload a dummy file using the same [update file API](https://octokit.github.io/rest.js/v16#repos-create-or-update-file) (indicating the branch name to create the branch).

2. Check for branch existence and create branch before uploading the image.

I believe this solution is not ideal as it adds more API calls, which can cause Github to block our access during the actual PE. Furthermore, this does not address the concern above, as we cannot create a branch out of an empty repository, for the first image upload.

&lt;hr>

According to the [PE instructions](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s2.github.io/website/admin/tp-pe.html#d-how-to-report-bugs), students should only be doing their PE through CATcher interface, so I believe it should be save to assume that repo starts out as an empty repo, and hence, it should be possible to indicate the branch name for updating files? Otherwise, if we were to be safe, should I proceed with creating a dummy upon repo creation?

> So for the initial commit, is it possible to specify the initial branch name to be whatever we want?

Yes, we can use upload file API call to ensure that the default branch is `main`. However, it only works if the repo is empty; if the repo already has some commits, we have to branch out from the latest commit. This means when a user logs in, we have to handle 3 cases separately:
* Create an initial commit by uploading a dummy file to branch `main` for empty repo.
* Branch out from latest commit for non-empty repo that does not have branch `main`.
* Do nothing for non-empty repo that has branch `main`.

I believe that for PE, if students follow instructions and do the PE using CATcher, the only way that it falls under 2nd or 3rd case is when they have previously created a repo with the exact same name (i.e. `alpha`, `ped` or `pe`).

> Perhaps we can use an optimistic processing approach instead? In other words, upload the image and then take corrective action if the upload fails due to missing branch

I would prefer this solution. I am thinking about if the upload fails, branch out from the latest commit in the repo, naming the new branch `main`, and retry the upload.

Would love to hear what you think about my suggested solution!

I have updated my PR! So in summary, the changes are only when user uploads a file:

* Attempt to create file in the repo with branch `main`.
* If failed, create branch `main` from the latest commit and retry.

I believe there is no difference in which one is a better code design, but I would prefer not putting style-related code into ts files. Also, I believe it is clearer to have a function that attaches each state of a label to a color.

Interesting discovery that `width` is not necessary 😮
`height` and `box-sizing` are necessary. `height` is to fix the height of each of the label.

For some context, previously, the labels are very clumped vertically. Hence I applied the height and margin to enforce spacing between the labels and so that the colored border has some height.

`box-sizing` is so that the height I indicate also includes padding and margin. Arguably, `box-sizing` property is not needed by indicating the new height as the current height subtracted by twice the vertically margin and padding, but I would not argue which one is better. I prefer to indicate height that includes margin and padding, hence using `box-sizing` property.

With regards to the indication of label states, I have thought about the solution of making the background color. However, remember that Github labels can be of any color, so red tags and green tags might blend in with the background. I would still prefer sticking with the border color, but incorporate strike through for deselected state. Please see updated screenshot in the PR description.

With regards to the color, I have picked from [Material Design color system](https://m2.material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html).

The bug on `Remove all` button has also been fixed.

Without the word `DEFAULT`, it might be mistaken that the auth service will never have access to private repos, while in fact, this is only the default settings when the app skips manual login. The app would still have access to private repos if the user chooses to (with manual login).

Phrasing the name as a boolean question (i.e. `HAS_PERMISSION_TO_PRIVATE_REPOS`) is more applicable when it is a boolean variable that can take up both values (i.e. `true` and `false`) in different scenarios, but in this case, it can only be `false`. Some might infer the variable name as the auth service always have access to private repos.

I would still be more inclined to use `NO_PERMISSION_TO_PRIVATE_REPOS`, because it really means "no private repo access", and is meant to be used only when the app has no private repo access. Unless there is a good way to incorporate the word `DEFAULT` into the constant name when phrasing it as a boolean question.

Can I clarify, do you mean that the type annotation for the field `labels` can be left as `Label[]`? The reason I changed the type annotation is because in the only place that this component is used, in `issues-pr-card.component.html`:

<mat-card-content>
  <app-issue-pr-card-milestone [milestone]="issue.milestone"></app-issue-pr-card-milestone>
  <app-issue-pr-card-labels [labels]="issue.githubLabels" [labelSet]="dropdownFilter?.hiddenLabels"></app-issue-pr-card-labels>

The `labels` field is given `issue.githubLabels`, which is of type `GithubLabel[]`.

This `value` being changed to `label.formattedName` only affects the values in `LabelFilterBarComponent::selectedLabelNames`. It is only used internally, to update the value of the behaviour subject field `LabelFilterBarComponent::selectedLabels`. In `LabelFilterBarComponent::simulateClick` and `LabelFilterBar::updateSelection` methods:

```ts
this.selectedLabels.next(this.selectedLabelNames);
```

`LabelFilterBarComponent::updateSelection` value is an `@Input` field. When looking for places that this component is used, it is only used in `FilterBarComponent`, in `filter-bar.component.html`:

```html
<mat-grid-tile class="label-filter-grid-tile" colspan="1">
  <app-label-filter-bar [selectedLabels]="this.labelFilter$" [hiddenLabels]="this.hiddenLabels$"></app-label-filter-bar>
</mat-grid-tile>
```

Hence any changes to `LabelFilterBarComponent::selectedLabels` will only cause a change to `FilterBarComponent::labelFilter$`. Looking at the places that this field is used, it is only used in `FilterBarComponent::ngAfterViewInit`, which subscribes to changes to this field:

```ts
    this.labelFilterSubscription = this.labelFilter$.subscribe((labels) => ``{``
      this.dropdownFilter.labels = labels;
      this.applyDropdownFilter();
    ``}``);
```

On every change, the `FilterBarComponent::dropdownFilter.labels` is changed, and then `applyDropdownFilter` is called, where the filter in each of the `views$` are updated to `FilterBarComponent::dropdownFilter`. Here, the `views$` are the child components that are filterable. It is an `@Input` field. Looking at places where `FilterBarComponent` is used, only in `issue-viewer.component.html`:

```html
<app-filter-bar [views$]="views" #filterbar></app-filter-bar>
```

The value of `FilterBarComponent::views$` takes the value of `IssueViewer::views`. `IssueViewer::views` is a field that follows the value of `IssueViewer::cardViews`:

```ts
  ngAfterViewInit(): void ``{``
    this.viewChange = this.cardViews.changes.subscribe((x) => this.views.next(x));
  ``}``
```

Which in turn is a `@ViewChildren` component that is of type `QueryList<CardViewComponent>`! This means that any change to `FilterBarComponent::dropdownFilter` will cause a change to the filters of all `CardViewComponent`s within `IssueViewer`.

TLDR, in short, the change of `value` from `label.name` to `label.formattedName` only means that all `CardViewComponent`s filter by `label.formattedName` instead of `label.name`. Note that `CardViewComponent` has selector `app-view-card`, so to double check where this change will affect, paste the following code to the browser's console when opening the app:

```js

We see that the `CardViewComponent`s are only the columns of the contributors of the current repo. This is the only component that takes the intended effect of the change.

I realised that the `LabelFilterBarComponent::hiddenLabelNames` needs a similar change. Similar to what I have explained above, the `CardViewComponent`s are the only component that takes the intended effect of the change. However, looks like it only hide the labels. I'm not sure if this is the intended behaviour of the hiding feature, if it not, there needs to be a change to how the `CardViewComponent`s make use of the `filter.hiddenLabels`.

> Since changing labels, hiddenLabels, deselectedLabels, sort and title do not make the preset view "custom", should we reset them or set them to a fixed value when setting the preset view?
> To me, it is unintuitive that since it is "not part of the preset views" since changing these parameters did not affect the status of my preset view being put into custom, choosing a preset view should not reset these parameters.

I agree. But currently, there is a regular label polling, and everytime the labels are fetched, the filters are reset, meaning that the "preset view" will be set to `Custom` after 5 seconds. I can't really think of a good way to handle this, other than having to compare whether the new labels are the same as the current filter. I would think we should not handle this in filter service, but rather, stop calling `filtersService::updateFilters` whenever the labels are fetched. Don't really want to fix that at the risk of introducing more bug at this stage.

> Additionally, is it intentional to provide currentlyActive preset with an invalid sort id of status?

I am assuming that #318 will be merged soon, so `status` will be a valid sorting ID.

I would be more inclined to standardise the preset views. The purpose of "currently active" preset view, for e.g., is to get the distribution of work between people within the current milestone. The user might forget to clear all label filters before setting the preset view to "currently active", and thereby get the wrong impression of the work distribution.

I would argue that the more important part of the preset view is to get the total count. So for the other filters not being tracked:

* Title: the user might want to search for a particular issue/PR. Technically, the user still stays in the same preset view, as the user is still in the same preset view when the search input is cleared.
* Sort: arguably, sort is an important part of the filters, especially for currently active, but user still can choose their own sorting order, and the total count of each column does not change.
* Labels, selected labels, deselected labels: as explained above, we can look into including these as one of the "tracked" filters.
* Hidden labels: This only affects which label is shown on each PR/issue card and which is not, so total count of each column does not change.

These are just my reasoning, let me know if you think otherwise.

I have found out an easy way to let the filters service track the labels fields as well. Because `sanitiseLabels` is only called whenever the labels are polled, I make sure that the update of filters from this method does not change the preset view value.

> In current implementation, seems like the preset view only include preset value for filters. What if we need preset view with different grouping in the future? Should we include groupby value in the preset value?

Agree, but given the time constraint until the next release, I would be more inclined to just focus on the filters first, and then let this preset view handle the groupby feature later. Also since logic for groupby is in a separate service, I would create another PR for the additional logic.

Please update your branch. We are no longer using `_validateFilters` in filters service.

Some preliminary comments on the filter:
* It does not work when I paste a URL containing the filters with milestones into the browser. It defaults back to selecting all milestones.
* Filters with one-value can be made more readable by removing the quotation marks around. For e.g. filter by type can be encoded as `type=issue` instead of `type="issue"`

Not sure why there needs to be this logic. Since we only want the actual milestones and not the default milestones, why not just do not append the two default milestones in `parseMilestoneData` at all? Instead of appending them and then slicing them off here.

Not really sure if creating a method to obtain the available list of milestones is really necessary. I think we can make use of `ngIf` directive to conditionally render the default milestone options? See `filter-bar.component.html`, lines 27-31 to see how the directive is used to conditionally render the status checkboxes.

Additionally, this also allows us to differ the text rendered from the value, i.e. the texts rendered should be `Issues without a milestone` and `PRs without a milestone`, the nouns with an `s`.

My TP repo has some issues unassigned to any milestone. However, the following steps would otherwise shows that there are no issue unassigned:

1. Make sure that your `Type` filter is `Pull Request`.
2. Select only `Without a milestone`.
3. Select `Type` filter to `Issue`.

In my opinion, we should deprecate the `Without a milestone` option totally, so that to eliminate this kind of bug.

An overlooked bug from a previous PR,

1. View the repo `AY2324S2-CS2103T-T08-2/tp`
2. Select milestones `v1.1` and `Issues without a milestone`
3. Switch to `AY2324S2-CS2103T-T08-1/tp` with keep filters option

Expected result: filter with milestones `v1.1` and `Issues without a milestone` should be used.

Actual result: filter is default back to all milestones.

Context: in `filters.service.ts`, lines 83-103:

```ts
    if (this.filter$.value.milestones.length === this.previousMilestonesLength) ``{``
      this.updateFilters(``{`` milestones: [...allMilestonesSet] ``}``);
      this.previousMilestonesLength = allMilestones.length;
      return;
    ``}``
    const newMilestones: string[] = [];
    for (const milestone of this.filter$.value.milestones) ``{``
      if (allMilestonesSet.has(milestone)) ``{``
        newMilestones.push(milestone);
      ``}``
    ``}``
    // No applicable milestones, reset to all milestones selected
    if (newMilestones.length === 0) ``{``
      newMilestones.push(...allMilestonesSet);
    ``}``
    this.updateFilters(``{`` milestones: newMilestones ``}``);
    this.previousMilestonesLength = allMilestones.length;
```

`this.previousMilestonesLength` is assigned to `allMilestones.length`, which excludes the default milestones. Instead, it should be assigned to `allMilestonesSet.size`, which includes the default milestones.

I'm not sure if this is the best practice to sync settings of a table component with the service. I would suggest the following:
* Service's settings values to be of type `Observable&lt;TableSettings>`
* Table component settings to sync with service's settings value using `Observable::subscribe`
* In these methods, only call `issueTableSettingsService::setTableSettings`

**Describe the bug**
Specifically, if a label has 2 or more period signs `.`, the filter registers the wrong label name.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. In a repo of your choice, create a tag with 2 or more period signs `.`, for e.g., `test.type.name`.
2. Attach an issue to the tag.
3. Watch the repo with WATcher.
4. The tags listed in the filter includes `test.type` instead of `test.type.name`.

Alternatively, you can watch my repo at [nknguyenhc/catcher-bugreporting](https://github.com/nknguyenhc/catcher-bugreporting).

**Expected behavior**
The tags listed in the filter should include `test.type.name`.

**Desktop (please complete the following information):**

- OS: Windows 10
- Browser: chrome
- Version: v1.0.0

**Additional context**
This might be because of how the constructor of a `Label` works. In `label.model.ts`:

```ts
constructor(label: ``{`` name: string; color: string; definition?: string ``}``) ``{``
  const containsDotRegex = /\.\b/g; // contains dot in middle of name
  [this.category, this.name] = containsDotRegex.test(label.name) ? label.name.split('.') : [undefined, label.name];
  this.formattedName = this.category === undefined || this.category === '' ? this.name : this.category.concat('.', this.name);
  this.color = label.color;
  this.definition = label.definition;
``}``
```

The input `label.name` is first split by periods `.`, and then the `formattedName` is only reconstructed from the first two parts of the name.

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**

The user has to login to WATcher regardless of whether they are viewing public repos only or including private repos. If the user is viewing public repos only, it does not make sense to require them to log in.

Furthermore, viewing any repo (by pasting the link directly to the browser) requires logging in regardless of whether the repo is public or private.

**Describe the solution you'd like**

Skip the login if the user only views public repo.

If the user visits the link to directly view a repo, the user should be able to view the repo without being redirected to the login page, if the repo is public.

@gycgabriel @damithc I have attempted to bypass logging in when viewing a public repo, but unable to fetch issues from GraphQL API endpoint.

![image](https://github.com/CATcher-org/WATcher/assets/87511888/89cbde2b-b031-4bf1-ad31-1344febaeb01)

It looks like Github does not allow access to GraphQL API from users not logged in. From [Github GraphQL docs](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/guides/forming-calls-with-graphql), it does look like one has to authenticate before using the GraphQL API endpoints. For reference, a REST endpoint not requiring Github login (with rate limit 60/hr) looks something like this:

![image](https://github.com/CATcher-org/WATcher/assets/87511888/b755b7cb-6824-4d36-8dd9-af833272ed02)

I am thinking of the following possible solutions, but I am not sure how feasible they are:

1. Switch away from GraphQL endpoints to REST.
2. Persist logging in credentials, so that when user visits a link to view a repo, does not have to log in again.

I would love to hear what you would suggest, or if I have missed out anything important!

> When the user login, what level of access is requested from the user? If it is read access to public repos, it might be more acceptable than asking for write access to private repos.

Currently, logging in to view public repos requests for read & write access to user's public repos (scope name `public_repo`), and logging in to view private repos requests for read & write access to user's all repos (scope name `repo`). Reference: [Github scopes for OAuth apps](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps#available-scopes).

With bypass logging in, the app does not ask for any read or write access from user. That is, the user is browsing the app as a public, not logged in, user.

@damithc In that case, to improve user experience for first time user, I think what we can do is to simplify the login process? I can imagine the use case as follows:

1. User paste the WATcher URL to view a repo into the browser.
2. Our app redirect to Github for authentication.
3. User authenticates on Github.
4. Github redirect to the correct page to view the repo.

As of now, the process is rather complicated because our URL does not indicate the repo one is viewing, and our app does not redirect to the intended landing page upon logging in, so the process is currently as follows:

1. User logs in WATcher and clicks login.
2. Our app redirect to Github for authentication.
3. User authenticates on Github.
4. Github redirects to our page.
5. User confirms logging in.
6. User indicates the repository to view.
7. Our app redirects to the page to view the repository.

This enhancement still requires the user to login to Github, but I believe it should simplify the process and improve user experience?

**Describe the bug**
When hiding a label, from the dropdown on the top right corner, only the labels are hidden, but not the related issues & PRs.

**To Reproduce**

1. Open any repository with active labels.
2. Click on hiding any label.

**Expected behavior**
It should hide the issues & PRs that have the label. The current behaviour is that only the label becomes hidden, but not the related issues & PRs.

I think it makes more sense that when a user clicks on hiding a label, the user wants to hide the relevant issues & PRs with the label.

I would agree with the 3-state checkbox as a solution to incorporate the feature of hiding relevant issues & PRs. Perhaps instead of presenting it as a checkbox, we can indicate green border around the label in the dropdown when filtering the label in (selected), and red when filtering the label out (negated)? I think by incorporating this 3-state button, we can also better present hiding just the label better as a feature than a bug.

For the feature of hiding just the label to reduce clutter, I think the feature is fine as it is right now. It is sometimes necessary to reduce the clutter when there are too many labels used on an issue. When the user wants to unhide the label, the user would still have to go back to the list to click on the eye icon. However, it would still be too much effort for the user to go through a long list of labels just to hide a label from the table. Perhaps a possible enhancement to this feature is to have an eye icon on the label on each issue/PR card, which the user can just click to hide the label from the table? Probably the eye icon should only be visible when the user hover the mouse over the label.

</div>

%%[created at: 2024 Feb 08 19:15:15]%%

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Currently, whenever the user wants to view a repo, user has to login, and then indicate the repo. There is no repo-specific URL that user can share with others. Furthermore, after authentication, the app does not redirect to the pathname initially indicated (if any)

**Describe the solution you'd like**
There are 2 parts to this issue:

1. Add repo-specific URL.

This means that a URL in our repo should indicate which repo the intended landing page will be viewing. For example, `https://catcher-org.github.io/WATcher/issueViewer?repo=CATcher-org/WATcher` indicates that the intended landing page will be viewing this repo.

2. Redirect to the intended-landing page.

This means that if the user put `https://catcher-org.github.io/WATcher/issueViewer?repo=CATcher-org/WATcher` to the URL bar in the browser, after authentication, our app should redirect to view the exact same page (i.e. to view this repo), instead of asking from user for which repo to view.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
As described below.

**Additional context**
This is to improve user experience, especially first-time user, as discussed in #236. We should try to simplify the process of logging in and viewing a repo for users. Bypassing logging in was considered, however, due to Github's limitation of 60 requests/hr for REST API endpoints and limitation of GraphQL API endpoints to only authenticated user, it was not very feasible.

@CATcher-org/2324s2 I took a look at the issue, the listing with `A B` is not a [standard list md syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#lists-1). The following code:

```md
1. Item 1
  A. Sub-item 1
  B. Sub-item 2
2. Item 2
  * Sub-item 3
  * Sub-item 4
```

would be rendered in standard markdown as:

![image](https://github.com/CATcher-org/CATcher/assets/87511888/dfdf3a28-fe1b-444c-b6cb-7d8bba369409)

Looks like the above syntax is only available in GFMD. I have attempted to add GFMD according to [ngx-markdown guide](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-markdown#using-the-markdownmodule-import-3), but there are a few things not available (import errors) due to difference in ngx-markdown version (ours: 11.2.0, current: 17.1.1).

Before I proceed to find other ways to fix this issue, can I check if we can add support for GFMD in our application, if I did miss out something important to solve this issue? Thanks.

I sometimes encounter this problem as well, when I paste the Heroku URL directly into the browser, it cannot redirect to the Heroku page, with `ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` error. I think this has something to do with the gatekeeper rather than CATcher. I'm not too sure when exactly it happens.

For the testing files of the new template, I generated using the updatetest script, but it creates the files with a timestamp, such that when it does the comparison with newly created files, the timestamp generated is different. Do you know how to solve this @EltonGohJH ?
I checked the files for the other templates and there aren't any timestamps, which would imply the newly created files used for comparison doesnt generate timestamps, unlike the testing of the new template, which is peculiar.

I updated the commit message body as well as completely removed any traces of ab3 as per mentioned in the comments. My thinking in leaving some traces was to try to strike a balance between reducing traces of ab3 and giving a clearer picture of what would a more realistic site would look like. I agree that removing and minimizing content would definitely be better considering it is just a template.

Under discussion as to how the visual issue is intended to work. Considering the original intension is to consider a list with icons and to ensure that every item in the list to have an icon, one suggestion I have is perhaps we can just display an icon for the items that you dont want an icon, where the icon looks like the bullet point of the unordered list.

Hi @LamJiuFong after testing, I realised that since we are running the job on merge, the author is already part of the list by the time the action is run, so it fails to detect the author as a new contributor. I will revert to the original implementation, and I will try to figure out if there can be performance enhancements.

Hi @itsyme, thanks for the review, it actually collects all the PRs, its just that it collects them 100 at a time for the pagination.

For preventing merge if label is missing, I'm thinking of having a "status" (implemented using status or something else), that will remain failed but never checked (so checks won't have to be done until the end).
The check will only happen `on label` trigger (to avoid multiple checks), that will check whether one of the 3 labels have been added, then pass the "status" and allow merging.

Also, as far as adding labels, an alternative to the current implementation of adding it at the end would be `on pr edited` trigger, immediately add the label to the PR, which will fit better for the `on label` method above.

Hi @kaixin-hc, it is currently implemented on PR merge since the labelling happens at the end, and on PR edit would keep running the job even if you are just editing the description or adding new commits. Hence I think on PR merge trigger would be better if we don't consider preventing the merge.

Due to security reasons, for permissions given to GITHUB_TOKEN, the maximum access for pull requests from public forked repositories is restricted to only read, so it is not possible to add labels since there is no write access. GitHub introduced the `pull_request_target` event that will bypass this restriction and give the token write access. 
Pros:
- It allows labelling of PR
- Increased security as base branch workflows can be trusted, protecting job from running modified and malicious workflows

Cons:
- It can only run on `pull_request` events and not `pull_request_review` events which means need to run on PR merge rather than on PR approved.
- This event runs in the context of the base of the pull request, rather than in the context of the merge commit, as the `pull_request` event does. This could lead to security vulnerabilities if scripts run are not properly checked for malicious code.
Can be aided by seeking approval before running the job, refer to [change repo settings](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository#controlling-changes-from-forks-to-workflows-in-public-repositories)

Alternative implementations
[**Workaround**](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67247752/how-to-use-secret-in-pull-request-review-similar-to-pull-request-target)
Pros: this can allow for still triggering on PR approved
Cons: immensely complicates the workflow

Create a PAT with the necessary permissions and add it to your repository's secrets. Then, modify the workflow to use this secret instead of the GITHUB_TOKEN. 
Pros: this can allow for still triggering on PR approved
Cons: exposes your repository to risks if the forked code can access the token

### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

As each of the groups are likely to have overlaps of needs when it comes to DevOps in general, and as more workflows are implemented, it may be useful to have a separate repo of GitHub workflows that can allow each group to reuse common workflows

### Describe the solution you'd like

Create a new repo containing workflows that can be called from workflows in other repos, ensuring all the necessary configurations and permissions are set properly to ensure flexibility and security, refer to [here](https://itnext.io/github-actions-working-with-reusable-workflows-625f79b0586f)

Hi @tlylt yes I was referring to purely development-related workflows. I was thinking since it is likely able to apply to other orgs that it would be worth setting up. I didn't consider that the repo itself required maintaining as well. Maybe it might be more worth in the future as the potential of utilizing DevOps is further tapped into, will have to see how it develops.

### GitHub Actions Security

**Specific version tags**
When using third-party actions, pin the version with a commit hash rather than a tag to shield your workflow from potential supply-chain compromise, since tags can be adjusted to a malicious codebase state but commit hashes provide immutability.
This can be done by going to the codebase for the specific tag version and looking for the latest commit of the version desired and copying the commit’s full SHA from the url link.
Use:
`uses: someperson/post-issue@f054a8b5c1271c37293245628f1cae047eff08c9`
Instead of:
`uses: someperson/post-issue@v7`
Downside is that the updates must be done by updating the commit hash instead of it being done automatically through moving the tag to a new release.
This can be solved by using tools like Dependabot or Renovatebot by adding a comment of the version used, enabling automated dependency updates. Tools like StepSecurity can also be used.

![image](https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/assets/105847348/24d04a56-4965-4eb7-bc2e-fa362356d6ec)

**Minimally scoped credentials**
Every credential used in the workflow should have the minimum required permissions to execute the job. 
In particular, use the ‘permissions’ key to make sure the GITHUB_TOKEN is configured with the least privileges for each job.
`permissions` can be restricted at the repo, workflow or job level.
**Environment variables**, like `$``{`` secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN ``}```, should be limited by scope, and should be declared at the step level when possible.


**Pull_request_target** (must be used for write access if PR is from forked repo)
Do not use actions/checkout with this as it can give write permission and secrets access to untrusted code. Any building step, script execution, or even action call could be used to compromise the entire repository. This can be fixed by adding code to ensure that the code being checked out belongs to the base branch, which would also be limiting since the code checked out is not up to date for the PR.
This can be done using:
```
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with:
    ref: $``{`` github.base_ref ``}`` 
```
Triggers workflows based on the latest commit of the pull request's base branch.
Even if workflow files are modified or deleted on feature branches, workflows on the default branch aren't affected so you can prevent malicious code from being executed in CI without code review.
Another solution that allows `pull_request_target` with `actions/checkout` used on the PR branch, is to add an additional step of running workflow only on approval by trusted users, such that the trusted user has to check the changes in the code from the PR to ensure there is no malicious code before running the workflow.

**Untrusted input**
Don't directly reference values you do not control, such as `echo “$``{``github.event.pull_request.title``}``”`, since it can contain malicious code and lead to an injection attack.
Instead use an action with arguments (recommended): 
```
uses: fakeaction/printtitle@v3 
with: 
title: $``{`` github.event.pull_request.title ``}``
```
Or bind the value to an intermediate environment variable:
```
env: 
PR_TITLE: $``{`` github.event.pull_request.title ``}``
run: | 
echo “$PR_TITLE” 
```

Use [**OIDC**](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect) and respective Secrets Manager for access to cloud providers instead of using secrets.
Use [**GitHub Secrets**](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions) to store keys securely and reference in workflows using `$``{````}```.
Can use [**GitGuardian Shield**](https://github.com/GitGuardian/ggshield-action?ref=blog.gitguardian.com) to help with scanning for security vulnerabilities.

Hi, I'm working on the checking of the coupled code portion now. I have thought about how to implement this, some considerations up for discussion. (This also applies to if Danger.js is used, since it also requires write access and also requires checking out of code)

Current implementation idea (or use Danger.js)
A file mapping list of files and their coupled test/docs file, which I think will have to be manually updated to provide better accuracy
A script to handle the logic (can also be part of workflow)
An action to handle checking of changes based on the mapping and script

This means that checking out of code is required, which means that pull_request_target should not be used for [security reasons](https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/issues/2488). A possible solution of setting the repo checked out to be the base branch repo, as per my [research](https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/issues/2488), does not work since the changes that we want to check from the PR would not be reflected in the base branch repo.

This means that there will be no write access given to the `GITHUB_TOKEN` since it is a PR from a forked repo, and hence I cannot ping the user with a comment.

However, I do not think directly failing the check is ideal either, at least for now since there could be hidden inaccuracies in the coupling of files, and would be problematic if it fails the test for a perfectly fine PR, preventing it from merging. But if it doesnt fail and just echoes something, then users might easily miss it.

Solutions:
One way to solve this is by still using `pull_request_target` anyways but add an additional step of running workflow only on approval by trusted users, such that the trusted user has to check the changes in the code from the PR to ensure there is no malicious code before running the workflow.

TLDR (all use Danger.js or a script)
Solution 1 (current implementation):
Use `pull_request` trigger event and echo an error and does not fail the action. (Less visibility)
Solution 2:
Use `pull_request_target` trigger event but type `on approved` for security reasons, which will then run and post a comment and does not fail the action. (More visibility but needs approval everytime)
Solution 3 (not ideal right now, but eventually ideal once accuracy is achieved):
Use `pull_request` trigger event and fail the action. (More visibility but requires coupling to be accurate)

### Benefits of 5.2.x

### 5.2.0
CSS variables
Custom properties to name frequently used variables
![image](https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/assets/105847348/efc04fda-713e-4cee-af69-33acdcece634)

Prevents the need for a CSS preprocessor like Sass that replaces the variables during compilation, or writing new selectors for every instance that would require changing of all those instances instead of just changing one variable.

Added a bunch of variables: Root, Component, Utility
In-built global property values (prefixed with `--bs-`), that can be easily customised to own liking
![image](https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/assets/105847348/f20941dc-cfac-4c9e-b3cb-0317fd7beb0a)

Root
Added variables for colors, body font styles, shared properties

Component
All new component variables can be found on the Bootstrap documentation, under the Variables section. For example, here are the new [Modal CSS variables](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/components/modal/#variables)


Example component customization:
![image](https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/assets/105847348/3c5f062d-4466-4211-b5de-08c9891c8fb4)


Utilities
Added variables for background color, border, text, customising alpha transparency value of `rgba()` colors.
![image](https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/assets/105847348/25d20fa8-8f97-450c-8c98-79ac0108b5b3)

Border opacity is also newly added

Other relevant additions
Added striped columns to tables via `.table-striped-columns` class.
Extra helpers and utilities for easier usage, like using `.text-bg-*` helpers to set background colour with contrasting foreground colour.

Customized maps (not sure if relevant to MarkBind)
New _maps.scss
A new Sass file with _maps.scss that pulls out several Sass maps from _variables.scss.
Sass has a limitation where once a default variable or map has been used, it cannot be updated. This led to an issue where updates to an original map were not applied to secondary maps that extend it.
For example, updates to $theme-colors were not being applied to other maps that relied on it (eg $utilities-colors). 

The following maps have been moved to the new _maps.scss:
```
$theme-colors-rgb
$utilities-colors
$utilities-text
$utilities-text-colors
$utilities-bg
$utilities-bg-colors
$negative-spacers
$gutters
```

### 5.2.1
General bug fixes and dependency updates
Updated `calc()` function
Changes: reverse order of multiplication inside `calc()` if multiplying negative number


### 5.2.2, 5.2.3
General bug fixes and upgrade of dependencies

**5.3.0**
**Color Mode Support**
Dark mode support as well as customizable color modes using `data-bs-theme`, with rebuilding of components to better respond to color modes
Color mode for whole page
```
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en" data-bs-theme="dark">
  &gt;!-- ... -->
</html>
```
Color mode for specific component
```
<div class="dropdown" data-bs-theme="dark">
  <button class="btn btn-secondary dropdown-toggle" type="button" id="dropdownMenuButtonDark" data-bs-toggle="dropdown" aria-expanded="false">

  <ul class="dropdown-menu" aria-labelledby="dropdownMenuButtonDark">
    <li><a class="dropdown-item active" href="#">Action</a></li>

**Link helper and utilities**
Can now use links with [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/)
![image](https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/assets/105847348/e092b020-7e26-44fc-89ae-2f2c6b21d932)

New classes for link opacity and underline offset, color and opacity


**5.3.1, 5.3.2, 5.3.3**
General bug fixes and enhancements for color modes, stabilises color modes and dark mode

**Bootswatch**
Themes have in-built dark mode support which can be easily accessed on the [Bootswatch blog](https://bootswatch.com/default/)

**Version 1.0.x using Windows through WSL**
Bun is supported for Linux and macOS. Currently Windows is not fully supported and only has an experimental build. Current best option before v1.1 is to use Bun within WSL, instructions can be found [here](https://bun.sh/docs/installation).

Note: for bun to work for these scripts itself, and any scripts that call them, need edit them
```
"csslint": "stylelint **/*.css **/*.vue",
"csslintfix": "stylelint **/*.css **/*.vue --fix",
```
```
"csslint": "stylelint \"**/*.css\" \"**/*.vue\"",
"csslintfix": "stylelint \"**/*.css\" \"**/*.vue\" --fix",
```

Test environment:
Git clone markbind and setting up 2 environments, one running npm commands and one running bun commands, timings vary each call and the following are just one sample size of comparison. Generally, there is little to no difference with occasional spikes of differences where bun is faster than npm, but also where npm is faster than bun.
Efficiency can be weaker due to certain commands being unreplacable by bun, such as `npm ci` and `lerna run prepare`.

Currently, the `on merged` implementation checks for all PRs of the repo to look for any PR of the author to determine whether the author is a new contributor, which can be slow in performance.
`Listing contributors` fails as running it `on merged` would be after the merge, so the author would be in the list of contributors already.

Without the limitation of it being `on merged`, such as any event before merged like `on PR opened`, it will work. I think this can be an acceptable implementation since it is just a reminder ping. This can also be aided by an `on merge` event that checks for this prior ping, to re-ping it on merge, allowing it to work fundamentally the same but with better performance.

I will try to see if there are any other possible implementations.

As per discussion with Prof @damithc, we can ping either specific people or active devs, whoever works best (maybe the person who merged it whom should be an active dev, so as to avoid pinging too many people), to add the contributor to the list of contributors, as well as a welcome message for the contributor. We assume that all users want to be added in.

Hi @yucheng11122017, the definition of inactivity for the github action you mentioned is any form of history to the issue, be it labelling, comments or references. What do you think would be a good timeline to unassign? I think 1 week might be too short since some issues can take longer than that before any PRs are made, especially with users juggling multiple issues. Perhaps 10-14 days will be good? I think any longer would be pointless, considering the timeline of a sem.

As for how it works (assuming action/stale is used):
1. `Stale` label added based on inactivity (default 60 days)
2. This action routinely checks for this `Stale` label, then checks whether its been a set amount of days after the `Stale` label has been added with no other activity
3. For issues passing the check before, it un-assigns users and removes `Stale` label

Hi @yucheng11122017 I think that would work, where I code it to add the `Stale` label after 6 days, then have the [unassign-contributor-after-days-of-inactivity](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/unassign-contributor-after-days-of-inactivity) run 1 day after.
I can also only do the check on issues that are actually assigned to someone, so that theres no redundancy.

Are we fine with adding `Stale` labels added to issues?

Hi @yucheng11122017, after researching into this abit more, it might be quite tough to ping the user directly, reminding them in a comment, since that will cause the issue to no longer be `Stale`. Commenting a generic comment asking the contributor to do something is fine though.
So "Please whoever is assigned this, get to it." is fine but "Please @KevinEyo1, get to it" won't work.

The definition of inactivity for the GitHub action mentioned is any form of history to the issue, be it labeling, comments or references. The action works such that issues and PRs are treated and checked for inactivity separately. This means that any updates done to a PR regarding this issue, will not reset inactivity for the issue.

How unassign and stale actions work:
1. Stale action adds `Stale` label to issue or PR based on inactivity (default 60 days)
2. Unassign action routinely checks for this `Stale` label, then checks whether it's been a set amount of days after the `Stale` label has been added with no other activity (default 7 days)
3. For issues passing the check before, it un-assigns users and removes `Stale` label

Reference workflow of real-life example: https://github.com/BoundfoxStudios/fairy-tale-defender/blob/develop/.github/workflows/project-management.yml#L105

### Solution using unassign and stale actions
Add the `Stale` label after 6 days and ping a reminder, then have the [unassign-contributor-after-days-of-inactivity](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/unassign-contributor-after-days-of-inactivity) run 1 day after.
It can also only check on issues that are actually assigned to someone, so that theres no redundancy.
**Limitations:**
1. Any changes in PR regarding issue will not reset inactivity of issue, meaning if discussion and updates are done on the PR instead of the issue, the issue risks being `Stale` and the user being unassigned despite them actively working on the PR.
2. It can ping a general reminder (without resetting the inactivity) but it cannot ping the user directly with `@username` in the reminder due to how the code is written. It is possible to separately ping the user in another comment but that will cause a reset in inactivity. This means slightly lower visibility for the reminder.

### Improvements for limitation 1 
(building on unassign action, which at some point it might be better off just building our own unassign action for better integration and control)
**Check corresponding PR (requires more implementation)**
Add additional check before setting `Stale` label to check if corresponding PR has history.
This can be done through checking the list of open PRs and their descriptions whether it mentions the issue. It can also be done through looking at the issue’s history, for PRs that mention it, then checking the history of those PRs. This should be quite manageable since the number of open PRs at any point of time is still relatively low for Markbind’s scale.

**Check corresponding issue (requires more implementation)**
On any activity in PRs, check description to find issues linked to the PR, so activity on PR can be translated to activity on the issue as well by posting a comment on the corresponding issue or something of that nature. This might require checking for a specific issue that has the user assigned to avoid commenting on relevant but not directly linked issues, if the PR has multiple relevant issues. We can also only call it on commits instead of any activity, so as to avoid over-polluting the issue with comments.

### Improvements for limitation 2
**Ping after unassign**
Same as before, add `Stale` level after 6 days, but don't need to ping the user, wait until unassign 1 day after, then ping the user that they have been unassigned and if they are still working on it, ask them to reassign themselves. This would likely fit better with a longer timeline.
This solves the visibility problem as it can directly ping the user as resetting the inactivity after the user has been unassigned wouldn't matter.

**Implement our own stale action (requires more implementation)**
Implement a simplified version of stale action that now allows pinging of user before applying the `Stale` label

@yucheng11122017  I have changed the warning message to only specify the file and not the code snippet.

![Screenshot 2024-03-13 at 10 07 58 PM](https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/assets/122192553/490b49f3-026f-46ad-90b6-99574c9c4878)

This is because I realised we can only get the code snippet if the `&lt;pic>` or `&lt;annotate>` is declared as a `&lt;variable>` due to how we process the source files.

However, I think it is sufficient to only show the file paths since the users can now have an idea on where to do the changes.
What do you think?

@yucheng11122017 Thanks for raising them up, I have not thought about the issues you mentioned when I was solving this issue.

Previously, I followed the user guide to enforce the aspect ratio 
https://markbind-master.netlify.app/userguide/components/imagesanddiagrams#pictures
But now when I think about it, maybe we should remove this constraint and leave it to the user to decide what they want

According to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65376615/set-height-of-image-with-100-width-for-cls-cumulative-layout-shift:

it seems like layout shifts won't occur if the widths and heights are relative.

Also, our current implementation of `Annotate` and `Pic` doesn't support the case where inputs are proportions eg. `width: 50%`. I think it is a good idea to support it but I am not sure if it should be tackled altogether in this issue because it looks like a separate feature?

Hi, I am currently working on this issue locally and I would like to ask for some advices:

This is what I've done:
1.  Update the dependencies to the latest versions and add the dependency `stylelint-config-recommended-vue` since stylelint doesn't support linting vue files and it is also a recommended config by stylelint.<img width="427" alt="Screenshot 2024-02-15 at 2 35 19 PM" src="https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/assets/122192553/2472e84e-50bb-4f8f-9abc-2ee68f9d1ea6">

2. Add `stylelint-config-recommended-vue` to the extension list and removed (commented out) the `indentation` rule since it is not supported by stylelint. <img width="688" alt="Screenshot 2024-02-15 at 2 39 30 PM" src="https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/assets/122192553/34a7d13f-6d07-4fe0-a18f-899db9411287">

3. Run `npm install` followed by `npm run csslintfix` and got the errors below:
<img width="831" alt="Screenshot 2024-02-15 at 2 42 14 PM" src="https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/assets/122192553/5f17c693-d7cd-4899-9258-d5ad094107ff">

4. Manually fix the errors above, no errors left.
5. Run `npm run updatetest` and `npm run test`. Successfully ran target test.

My questions are:
1. Is it the right way to solve this issue by following the steps above? Did I miss out anything?
2. Do I need to change anything in the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file? If not, is it because Github Actions will run the `ci.yml` in my code which uses the updated dependencies.
3. Some new rules are introduced and running `npm run csslintfix` changes the original code.
eg. `border-color: rgba(150, 150, 150, 0.2)` is changed to `border-color: rgb(150 150 150 / 20%)`. Is it okay to keep the new changes? I think it should be fine as long as the syntax is standardised everywhere.
4. Not sure why some css files are included in `.stylelintignore`, could someone explain the purpose of it? Thanks!

> Looks correct on my end. For the indentation rule can you check on whether we can get a replacement?

I have added a plugin `@stylistic/stylelint-plugin` to solve this issue as they support the deprecated `indentation` rule.

> I dun think so? We still run `npm run test` command in CI? (There is no change right?) If any change, you should change our test command.

Yup, there is no change

> I agree that if you can fix and ensure that this new style is standardised in current code base then it is good to go.

Ok

> 4. Vue components folder also has coverage folder. Maybe you can specify just the coverage folder? I dun think our vue components folder has css files. (Double check)

Yes, I checked and there is no css files in the `vue-components` folder. 


Something to add on:

I ran to this error when running `npm run csslint`:

SyntaxError: Named export 'Input' not found. The requested module 'postcss' is a CommonJS module, which may not support all module.exports as named exports.
CommonJS modules can always be imported via the default export, for example using:

import pkg from 'postcss';
const ``{`` rule: _rule, Input ``}`` = pkg;

This is because `@stylistic/stylelint-plugin` uses named export for `Input` and `postcss` only supports this starting from v8,

So, I added a dependency to specify the version of `postcss` to `&hat;8.4.35` to get over this issue.

Hi, good idea! I was thinking if we want to do this validation, we can actually just do the validations (including check if port is unavailable, check if host is being used etc) all at once before building the pages. Currently, all these validations are done after building the pages. 

Since this PR is focusing on adding another small feature, I suggest we create a separate issue and pull request to specifically address this validation issue. What do you think?

Hi @yucheng11122017 @lhw-1, thank you for the suggestions. Initially I was thinking of setting 0.0.0.0 as the default host so that the users can run the server once there is any available host. However, I did overlook the safety issues of allowing this to happen. I think it's good to set '127.0.0.1' as the default host.

I will work on the descriptions too.

@yucheng11122017 @itsyme 
I researched on the difference between the null coalescing operator `??` and the OR operator `||` and found out that the main difference between them is during the handling of falsy values like 0, empty string, empty list etc.
eg. ` 0 ?? 100` will return `0` but `0 || 100` will return `100`. 

I was thinking if we should use the `??` operator while handling missing host and port (line 161-162) so that if the user specifically enter `0`, markbind will not default it to a specific host/port defined by us. 
eg. using `0 || 127.0.0.1` will set the host to be 127.0.0.1 but `0 ?? 127.0.0.1` will set the host to be 0.0.0.0
I feel like the latter is more suitable. What do you think?

Hi @EltonGohJH @yucheng11122017 

Thanks for your suggestions! I have updated my code accordingly

> I would prefer it if it is in the same file as that is sort of the problem highlighted that we want nunjucks to be supported in variables.md. I am wondering whether it is possible to remove the variables before processing it with nunjucks? Or maybe not rendering it in the first place.

My current approach is to comment out every `\<variable\>` so that nunjucks won't render them
By doing this, we are now able to support nunjucks set in `variables.md` 

This method (commenting out the variables) comes with one restriction: 
This works (original version):
```
<variable name="node_version_number">16</variable>
<variable name="node_version">v``{`` node_version_number ``}``</variable>
```
But the following doesn't work:
```
' set node_version_number = 16 '
<variable name="node_version">v``{`` node_version_number ``}``</variable>
```
In short, ' set ' and \<variable\> does not work together


> Yeah I agree with @EltonGohJH. Plus the original discussion disagrees with the implementation detail of prepending the file to each of the files and I do think it is a bit hacky to do it this way.

I think it is tricky to implement our own parser to collect all the variables because there are many use cases to consider eg. different data types, math operations, applying functions etc. Our own parser might not be able to support more complex situations though

Restrictions that we need to document in the User Guide:

1. `' set '` does not work well with `\<variable\>` as stated in the previous comment, but their own use cases are preserved
2. Priority order:  `\<variable\>` >  `' set '` in local files > `' set '` in `variables.md` 
Hence we need to change the following:
<img width="963" alt="Screenshot 2024-04-13 at 12 11 46 PM" src="https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/assets/122192553/435c9bb2-cf21-46b8-a7f6-a9dc80f24fed">

The original priority relationship `\<variable\>` > `' set '` in local files is still preserved in this case

I personally think that these trade-offs are okay? Since they preserve the original features, in other words, there is no change to users who do not use the new feature

Can add these variables to `variables.md`:

' set a = 123 '
' set b,c = 100 '
' set items = [99, 100, 101, 102] '

' set subtotal = 5 '
' set taxRate = 0.10 '
' set totalTax = subtotal * taxRate '
' set totalAmount = subtotal + totalTax '

' set hi = "hi" | upper '

' ext studentScoreboard = "userGuide/syntax/extra/scoreboard.json" '
```

and add use them anywhere, for example:
```
``{`` b ``}``
``{`` c ``}``

' for i in items '
``{`` i ``}``
' endfor '

' ext studentScoreboard = "userGuide/syntax/extra/scoreboard.json" '

Student Number | Score | Rank
:----- | :-------: | ----
' for student in studentScoreboard.students -'
``{`` student.number ``}`` | ``{`` student.score ``}`` | ``{`` student.rank ``}``
' endfor '

<small>Last updated at ``{`` studentScoreboard.lastUpdated ``}``</small>

> 1. It could impact performance, especially for larger files or projects with many files.

I agree with this, I think this is part of the tradeoff. I think we can definitely improve the current proposed solution

> 2. If a file already has Nunjucks syntax or comments, I am not sure if prepending the content will lead to conflicts.

I couldn't think of any case where conflicts may happen, do you have any ideas?

> Instead of modifying individual files, I also support configuring the Nunjucks environment to load `variables.md` during initialization. That way, the variables will be available to all templates without needing to modify each file.

I am not sure how to achieve this, do you have any idea in mind?

> Another option could be using Nunjucks' `addGlobal` method or creating a separate config file for `VariableRenderer`-specific variables.

I think the issue with using `addGlobal(name, value)` is how we extract the names and values from a file containing ' set xxx = xxx ' if we are not creating our own parser to parse the file.

> Overall, while the proposed solution might work, it goes against the principle of separating concerns. It's generally better to keep variable declarations centralized and configure the rendering environment appropriately for cleaner code organization and maintainability.

Yup, I agree on this, will work on it!

@EltonGohJH @yucheng11122017
I have investigated the issue in the test file, I think the issue is caused by the `renderString` method that I'm using to render the contents.

1. Firstly, the string that I pass into the `renderString` method contains a lot of `\n`, hence there is some newlines added in the test file. Eg
![Screenshot 2024-05-03 at 9 50 39 PM](https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/assets/122192553/eb2a576b-46dc-4037-8037-6989c7654b8a)

However, the newlines does not affect the rendering of the HTML files

2. I think the issue [here](https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/pull/2474/files#diff-43a859d4db1f0a51d25b6d5743077fc3f7e70c0efba1dd34572bc7ac0f975488R549) is possibly due to `renderString` ignoring whitespaces, that's why there is no &lt;br> in the output. 

We should not allow this as it affects the rendering output of the HTML files

To add on, there are two ways to render the content - `renderString(string)` or `render(file)` (the original implementation)
These are the problems faced using both methods:
1. `renderString`: Takes a string as input and renders the string, so we **create a new string** by combining the content from `variables.md` and the target file, but this method will have issues with whitespaces/newlines as shown above
2. `render`: Takes a file as input and renders the file, we need to create **a new file** that actually prepends `variables.md` to the target file, this method will cause a lot of overhead and will slow down the app in general

@luminousleek Thanks for the great work! I have a few ideas:

1. I think it is fine to not print out the message to the console, using `toHaveBeenCalledWith()` to check the input of the logger is enough to ensure the correctness of the method.

2. Since we are probably going to use the mock logger and the mock functions in other test files, do you think it is a good idea to create a manual mock instead so that we do not have to reimplement the mock functions again in other files?
For your reference, [jest-manual-mocks](https://jestjs.io/docs/manual-mocks)

3. If I'm not wrong, the mock logger is shared among all the tests in a file, in other words, the mock logger's data is not resetting for every test and is actually accumulated. I am thinking of adding something like :
```
afterEach(() => ``{``
    jest.clearAllMocks();
``}``);
```
 to reset the logger to a clean state after every test. Might not be very useful for now but I think it is safer to do so, because issues might arise in the future (eg. checking mock.calls.length)

Please feel free to add your comments!

Since there are some repeating codes (width and height), would it be better to refactor `setPosition()` in this way:
```
// create a map
const placementStyles = ``{``
  "top": ``{`` 
    top: '20px', 
    left: '50%', 
    transform: 'translateX(-50%)' 
  ``}``,
  "top-right": ``{`` 
    top: '20px', 
    right: '20px' 
  ``}``,
  "top-left": ``{`` 
    top: '20px',

  ``}``,
  "bottom": ``{`` 
    bottom: '20px',

  "bottom-right": ``{`` 
    bottom: '20px', 
    right: '20px' 
  ``}``,
  "bottom-left": ``{`` 
    bottom: '20px', 
    left: '20px' 
  ``}``
``}``

setPosition() ``{``
  const announcementElement = this.$refs.announcement;
  if (!announcementElement) return;
  const ``{`` width, height ``}`` = announcementElement.getBoundingClientRect();

  // get the respective styles from the map
  const positionStyle = ``{`` ...placementStyles[this.placement] ``}``;

  // since only width and height are specified in these cases
  if (this.placement.endsWith('right') || this.placement.endsWith('left')) ``{``
    positionStyle.width = `$``{``width``}``px`;
    positionStyle.height = `$``{``height``}``px`;
  ``}``

  this.positionStyle = positionStyle;
``}``
```
By doing this, next time if we introduce a new placement (eg. middle-left), we can just add the corresponding style to the map.

This part lgtm but I am thinking of an alternative

Instead of checking all prs and see if there is any previous prs by the pr creator, I am thinking if we could utilise Github's built-in function to get the current list of contributors and check if the person is inside

https://docs.github.com/en/rest/repos/repos?apiVersion=2022-11-28#list-repository-contributors

Not sure if this approach would speed up the process since we do not have to go through every closed pr

Hi I've done some research too, the layout shift happens because the browser does not know how much space should be reserved for the image, leading to layout shifts when the image is fully loaded.

It seems like the solution that people generally use is specifying the height and width of the image, same as @yucheng11122017's third point. It allows the browser to reserve the correct space for the image before it is loaded.

If we add the option of lazy/eager loading, maybe we can ask the users to input the height and width manually if they want lazy loading (and warn them about the consequences if they don't do so)? But I am not sure if it will be troublesome for them since not all users knows the exact height and width that they want

What do y'all think?

Maybe because the `.gitignore` is not released as part of the package due to some restrictions of npm (they don't allow .gitignore to be part of a package). Hence the file will not be copied over when running `markbind init`
![Screenshot 2024-03-16 at 8 28 08 AM](https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/assets/122192553/6a64594d-1e3c-456a-a9f6-724802275147)

A common workaround is to rename the `.gitignore` to `gitignore` before publishing. Then as part of an init script, rename the `gitignore` file to `.gitignore`.
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24976950/how-do-i-include-a-gitignore-file-as-part-of-my-npm-module

I have tried to publish my own package and the `.gitignore` file I created is indeed not published on npm. And it is also possible to copy a `gitignore` file to a `.gitignore` when doing init. I will work in this direction and try to resolve this issue.

Yup, it only worked after I ran `npm unlink markbind-cli`

However, according to https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-uninstall#examples, `unlink` is just an alias for `uninstall`, so not sure what was the issue when running `npm  un -g markbind-cli`

Edit: 
I am thinking of this potential reason:
`npm unlink` uninstalls the local package and `npm un -g` uninstalls the global package but not the local package
When we run a module, it will first search from the local packages (node_modules). If there exist a local package, it will use it instead of using the global package. 
That's why running `npm un -g markbind-cli` and `npm i -g markbind-cli` wouldn't work since the local package is not affected and still links to the local `markbind-cli`

I gave @Tim-Siu this set of instructions to try replicating the bug on his Mac: 
```
1. remove Layout.ts in core/src/Layout
2. npm run setup
3. npm link in packages/cli

then in an empty folder:
3. npm link markbind-cli
4. marbind init (should have an error)
5. npm un -g markbind-cli
6. npm i -g markbind-cli
7. markbind init (observe if there is still any error)
```

Our results in Step 7 is different, @Tim-Siu's one has no error but mine still has the same error in Step 4.
However, I tried another approach (adding another command  `npm unlink markbind-cli` right before Step 5) and it doesn't work too.
I think it might be my own laptop's problem

Hi @tlylt , so sorry for the late reply.

> I see. The steps in the docs should be relevant in the case that you are working on another node/npm project that relies/imports on your npm package. In our case we are making a cli tool available globally, it's not necessary for you to make in available in the folder that you want to invoke it in order to call the markbind cli (iirc).

Ohh I see, I agree with you that it is unnecessary to do `npm link markbind-cli` again in our case.

> Also btw...you still have not posted the exact error message🙃

These are the exact error messages
1. After deleting Layout.ts and run `npm run setup`, this error occured:

> I wonder if your empty folder is not an empty one but one with a node_modules as mentioned in the docs, will the error still occur? You can populate it by running npm init -y

I tried this method in another folder after running `npm init -y`, and followed the workflow above. 
The same errors occured though (I followed the same steps 1-4)

However, after adding the Layout.ts back and running `npm run setup`,
I ran `markbind init` in both folders, and there is no error:

This was the exact issue:
<img width="380" alt="Screenshot 2024-04-08 at 6 50 38 PM" src="https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/assets/122192553/f8d465f8-aa7f-48f7-a802-cd63844064c0">

I believe the issue occurred due to the dependencies between this script and the deferred scripts:
<img width="634" alt="Screenshot 2024-04-08 at 6 51 44 PM" src="https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/assets/122192553/ffda8f3d-7ec7-4ada-a40c-91858de6975b">

Once the scripts in the second image are deferred, they are executed later than the first one, hence there is a reference error.

Solution:
We have to make sure that the four scripts are being executed before the first one, in this case, we cannot use `defer` because
i. deferred scripts are loaded last (as stated above)
ii. While `defer` preserves execution order, adding `defer` to the first script component still cannot work because `defer` only works on `<script>` with a `src` attribute.

However, we can still move the scripts to the bottom (have to make sure they are above the first script).
It can still save rendering time as the files are executed after all DOM elements are loaded.

@yucheng11122017 thanks for the suggestions, I have tried them out:

> Could you investigate on the performance difference when pushing the scripts to the bottom vs our current implementation?

On my end, pushing the scripts to the bottom takes ~17s to load the DOM content while the current implementation takes ~20s to load

> Is it possible to change the first script to use a `src` attribute?

I think this will be tricky as we have to add js files as one of the `asset` of a `PageConfig` when creating new pages in `Site/index.ts::createPage`, it would probably involve some refactoring of code

Perhaps just moving the scripts to the bottom is enough, what do you think?

Thanks for the idea! I think placing the thumbnails and icons on the homepage should remain though because many of the examples have such thumbnails/icons on the homepage to give a quick overview of their skills. I think if we were to move the thumbnails/icons from the homepage, maybe I could move to the skills page instead?

Hi Charisma! Thank you for your feedback. I think I can definitely change the skills section so the panels are open by default. For the projects section, each project is shown on an individual card so they are already open by default. I looked at your website again and I think the "featured projects" and "other projects" sections are interesting. Maybe the current big cards can be for featured projects, and I can add a grid of smaller cards underneath that to show other projects.

I think the "Hello!" section looks better with the text aligned to the left? It looks neater in my opinion. 😓 
But I think I can def move the links to this header section

Also sorry about not having a netlify link previously, I've since set it up here: https://portfolio-template-markbind.netlify.app/

Hello! Thank you @lhw-1 , @kaixin-hc for the feedback. I've revamped the look of the portfolio template so that it would look more sleek. All information (skills, experience, etc.) is just displayed on 1 page now and I hope that it would look more like the examples given.

One issue I'm facing is whether to add a section that introduces new users to the site, and to MarkBind features overall. I have added a small tip on the homepage that links users to the user guide, but I'm wondering if I should add a small section on introducing the site and give some tips about what features they might find useful (similar to the "Navigating this page" section on the current default template) to help first-time users editing the page.

@damithc thank you for the insight! Can I clarify if the approach means creating 2 templates, one generic, and the other one a full fleshed out sample of the first template for 2103 students? I think it’ll be helpful for 2103 students, but personally I have some similar reservations as @kaixin-hc in terms of using placeholders if we were to create a full sample. 

I think I can create some examples (e.g an example iP showcase) and guides (e.g guide to deploy on github) on the current template to give 2103 students a starting point on their portfolio while showcasing MarkBind’s features to other CS students.

Hello! I'm trying to implement this but I'm having trouble with indexing the generated HTML pages using the methods provided by the Plugins, so any tips or comments to point me in the right direction would be greatly appreciated! 

I'm also investigating adding pagefind as a dependency, adding it to the current build process (`index.ts`) so that an index can be created after the site is built. However, I'm having issues importing the NodeJS API package. Currently Pagefind's npm interface only supports being used as an ESM module via `import`, rather than as a CJS package through `require`. So `import * as pagefind from 'pagefind'` would be acceptable, but `const pagefind = require('pagefind')` would result in the following error:

```
message=No "exports" main defined in /Users/wangjingting/markbind/node_modules/pagefind/package.json, stack=Error [ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED]: No "exports" main defined in /Users/wangjingting/markbind/node_modules/pagefind/package.json

    at /Users/wangjingting/markbind/packages/core/src/Site/index.js:509:92, code=ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED
```

This issue can be resolved using async import, and I've used it in `Site.ts` to import the functions with no issue. However, the generated `Site.js` file would then still convert the import to `require('pagefind')`, which results in the import issue. 

More specifics can be found in [this discussion.](https://github.com/CloudCannon/pagefind/issues/471), and [here on cjs-esm import compatibility](https://adamcoster.com/blog/commonjs-and-esm-importexport-compatibility-examples)

If anyone has any ideas on how best to continue, or if I've missed something, please help me out. Thank you!

This is to ensure that the break also inherits the colour of the text, or else it would always be a dark colour. 
For example with the inherit property:
<img width="768" alt="Screenshot 2024-04-07 at 4 55 42 PM" src="https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/assets/105090139/94f89710-4edc-4a3b-8079-c9f1ff7ec6df">

without the inherit property:
<img width="768" alt="Screenshot 2024-04-07 at 4 55 21 PM" src="https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/assets/105090139/4c4a5b49-d3fd-4920-bd95-1a71dcb8d9f7">

As you can see without these changes the `<hr>` break might sometimes be unnoticeable against the parent's colour

I've changed it now so that both the seamless and non-seamless morph wrapper would share the same basic styles, and only `morph-display-wrapper-seamless` will have the `color:inherit` property. This allows for future changes to the styles of all morph wrappers to be done in one place and allows the seamless wrapper to have the same styles as the other wrappers

yep sure, I've put the example into a panel and changed the explanation to make it more clear! I think since this issue is about links breaking when being included with `&lt;include>`, the note at the includes section in the UG and troubleshooting section is also just about this specific problem. 

If there's another cause to the link breaking issue other than `include` I think we can make a more generic one?

thanks @kaixin-hc for the suggestion! I've done more testing on [my deployed branch](https://jingting1412.github.io/teammates/) and have since updated the description to better reflect the nature of the changes and to add images. 

Regarding the `variables.md` file, I think its up to the TEAMMATES team if they still want to keep it or not. Its a useful tool to have in case they would like to declare variables in the future. You can read more about it in our user guide [here](https://markbind.org/userGuide/reusingContents.html#global-variables)

Maybe you can differentiate the error and warning messages to make it more clear. The error message can be something more serious like `Failed to process invalid HTML in $``{``path``}``, $``{``description``}``` while the warning message can be something more informative like `Invalid HTML detected in $``{``path``}``, $``{``decription``}``` similar to what you have now

Thanks for working on this! Just some nits on improving logger messages and property names. It would be good to add some tests and documentation for this as well.

Similar to other reviewers, I also think that encapsulating the existing rules to another class for example would be good to better manage rule registration and execution.

Hello I've been looking at this issue and one problem I've encountered is how contents in components that are hidden to the user during the initial render (e.g. Panels) are not included in the search results. This is because libraries like Pagefind indexes the content only after the HTML files have been built. This rendering problem is also faced by other plugins like dataTable (@Tim-Siu) and Mermaid (@yiwen101 @LamJiuFong)

This behaviour is also similar to the Algolia DocSearch we use now that automatically adds `algolia-no-index` to content hidden by MarkBind's Vue components, causing content hidden in panels to similarly not show up in search results.

With this in mind, I'm just making sure if the behaviour of the results of the full text search we want to implement should include content that are included in panels, or it is ok for them to not show up in the search results

Hello, one interesting thing I've noticed is that https://markbind-master.netlify.app/userguide/usingplugins#plugin-web3forms which deploys when there's a push to the master branch looks fine. As the current https://markbind.org/ only deploys whenever there's a tag, maybe something went wrong during [this commit](https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/commit/d8a251a931174f74bf90de7245b09e7068aeb578). The timestamp on the current ug also matches with this commit.

In terms of the actual issue, I think the web3 form wasn't rendered correctly. 
This is how its supposed to be rendered (taken from my local build):
<img width="513" alt="Screenshot 2024-03-21 at 10 39 23 PM" src="https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/assets/105090139/4b0b40b7-3138-4048-9650-5ca05cbb166d">

And this is how its incorrectly rendered now:

I want argue for the current code here;

To test the internal state of the siteLinkManager, we need to either 1 write getter for the filePathToHashesMap, 2 write comparator inside the SiteLinkManager 3 add print method.  I think 3, the current way is the least intrusive (and most helpful when I do debugging with console.log)

Regarding the aspect not related to internal state: 

When the "maintainHashesForInclude" is called, the heading names is already processed, and we do not know how many same headings has been processed since then, so we can not just anyhow append the name with the number of times it has occured (or minus something).

The appending with the number of times something occur is because id must by unique. This happens internally and the user does not know, so we should not be expecting user to include the -$``{``counter``}`` in the first place.

A not so important but still valid reason is that, the existence of $``{``name``}``-``{``counter``}`` necessitates the existence of $``{``name``}``, so no matter what the current state is, it is never wrong to return the name without counter.

@EltonGohJH 
Thank you so much for your reply, I was not aware that I can do testing like this in typescript before! This is valuable learning point for me;

I have deleted this method in the latest commit, and created a class extending the siteLinkManager as instructed by you. It works well!

Emm, I see; thanks for pointing this out;
I have come up with a list of potential names for it, but not sure whether "EnhancedSiteLinkManager" is the best choice. "TestableSiteLinkManager", "UtilitySiteLinkManager", "TestHelperSiteLinkManager" and  "AccessibleSiteLinkManager" are some other choices.  What is your idea?

It turns out that my code is good. All the 15 mismatches are actually legitimate broken links :(

I will fix all the broken links with hash in this PR as well. For ease of verification of reviewer, I will also post pictures of the positions of these broken hash links here:

The additional cost should be negligible, and literally invisible (as master branch in theory should run faster when all other factor hold constant, but it turns out run the slowest, suggesting that even the fluctuation in runtime caused by other factors has significantly higher impact than the runtime contributed by the changes)

Sorry for getting back to the review late; was overwhelmed by a hackathon due Friday this week

@kaixin-hc 
Thank you for the careful review and suggestions. Could you help elaborate further on how could I add this to test site?
Current implementation of the functional test seems only adequate of recursively comparing the files in the expected folder and the actual files during the build process. I do not know how to "expect" error logs. The [PR](https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/pull/1382/files) that brings in the intra-link validation feature also did not add functional test. 

@EltonGohJH @yucheng11122017 
Thank you for the careful review; I have made the requested changes and added method document.

The only exception is the "print" method in SitelinkManager. Although it is most for test purpose, I believe that it is a necessary evils and the best resort among all choices, so should leave it as it is.

@yucheng11122017 
Thank you for your careful review and various suggestions on improving code quality.

In a later commit, I made following changes to existing methods to improve code quality. They are:
1 rename "processAndReturnHeadingId" back to "setHeadingId", and modify its behaviour accordingly.
2 remove the "forceWrite" from `maintainFilePathToHashesMap`
3 modify the maintainHashesForInclude accordingly.

I hope that the code becomes clearer after the changes.

Motivation being, as this initially is to fix the error in display footnote in the user doc, I decided to be defensive and do the best (without going beyond the scope and making changes outside the` hash` part) to strive for making importing footnote from a single hash look good.

Thanks for the careful review. 
The the number 1-1 is an unintended bug, thank you for pointing it out!
The footnoteNumber is just a temporary placeHolder; the thinking is that when I/somebody attempt 2430 in the future and add footnoteNumber as an argument to this method, the rest of the code does not need to be changed (wait, just come to me, how to do passing by reference in javascript? nevermind, there must be a way to do it).

Hi, there is a strange behaviours. There should not be any outdated changes to master from branch, but it says "This branch is out-of-date with the base branch"

This is what I did: 
// my master branch is up to date, currently at the layout_ts branch
```
git merge master
git rebase -i HEAD~2
pick ......
squash ....
squash ...
...
git push -f
```

Update: issue resolved by simply pressing `update branch with rebase` from github page (@kaixin-hc thank you so much for telling me this trick in previous PR!!!)

But still curious which of my steps before is wrong.  

Thanks.

Hi @kaixin-hc, after studying the code base,It seems that to write non-trivial test cases to cover the lines not covered (constructor for the external and external manager) is almost equivalent to writing test to the whole External package.

Currently, there is not test for the external package in the code base. So no available mocks to use.

While there are test for Site and Page, the existing mocks seems can not be modified to incorporate testing involving "External" without significant changes.

External manager is only used in "Site" as a parameter to call the "Generate" method of "Page". So I conclude that it impossible to test these lines non-trivially without creating the test for the External package as a whole, including related mocks and utils.

I wonder is my observation correct so far? Could I seek you help and enlighten me on how could I proceed from here? Thanks!!!

Thanks for the comment; yes this is a very valid concern.
Will modify the documentation to warn this unintended effect of including source that contains script and css. 

How do you find the idea of adding a new attribute to allow the user to choose whether to hoist the css and script? Cause I feel a documentation warning is best when complemented with feature that providing user with more options. If you approve the idea, I will open a separate issue and work on adding the attribute in addition to documentation fix.

Meanwhile, s commented in #2300, probably worth opening a new issue on "finding a more proper fix that retains the script element placement instead of hoisting it downward." as well?

I see;  

Regarding the usefulness of the attribute, if I am correct in my understanding, without this attribute, I will need to mention in documentation that: 
  1 Including a source with style will cause that to be applied globally
  2 If do not want this, go to copy paste from the source rather than use "src= ...". ?
 
Point 2 does not look graceful. By adding a new attribute (not sure how long will take me though), we can replace point 2 with "If do not want this, add `importStyle = false` ... ", so it looks more elegant?

Thanks for your detailed reviews!

The two txt file are the real value of "content" when running `markbind build` on default index.md and index.md with only 
```
<table class="table">
   <tr>
     <th>Task ID</th>
     <th>Task</th>
     <th>Estimated Effort</th>
     <th>Prerequisite Task</th>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>E</td>
     <td>Planning for next version</td>
     <td>1 man day</td>
     <td>D</td>
   </tr>
 </table>
 ```
 respectively.

I feel by doing this, it will be more robust testing than manually made test string.

To target the issue of "not focused enough", I add another test cases whose only difference is it has the open and close `tbody`tag, to contrast the previous test case.

Yes, and that is the current design: At page/index,ts, it will call `checkForVueHydrationViolation` with content as string. The cheerio.load will only be called once per Page.

@kaixin-hc @tlylt @yucheng11122017 @jingting1412 

Thank you for all the comments and sorry about the later reply.

On second thought, I feel that although this is a quite simple, trivial and straightforward addition, the current code still complicating it unnecessarily. I wish to remove all the over-engineered parts, and reduce this PR to a simple validation of `table` tag has `table body` (the only violation that for sure leads to hydration as of now). What is your guys idea on this?

Let me explain where the current design comes from, and why it sucks.

Initially I want to add an extensive rule based checkers. However as commented [here]( https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/issues/2025), it turns out that modern browsers are quite robust and can tolerate most of the common html violations (eg: nesting block level in inline level, missing closing tag, missing quotation for href...) . So `causeHydration` tag is designed to differentiate `harmless` violations and violations that leads to hydration.

However, since `harmless` violations are so pervasive (eg: even in 404.md), the false positive rate is unacceptable. Logging check results for them may bury and hide the actual, valuable logs. I see no point wasting computation power and brain cell to fill the mental bandwidth of log reader with results that they do not need to know and do not need to fix.

With "table body missing" being the only known violations that will for sure leads to hydration, I want to remove all over-engineered parts and make it the simplest, most straightforward form. What are you thoughts on this?

> @yiwen101 can users use an escape sequence (e.g., `\,`) if they want the `,` to be part of the text label?

Hi prof, this is not supported in current implementation of this PR. But it should be easy to add.

In our discussion beneath, Yu Chen also suggests the alternative of using `&lt;div id="demo" data-stuff='["some", "string", "here"]'>&lt;/div>` as the syntax to parse an array of string. In that way, the "," can be used in the icon. I feel the syntax is a big clumsy as I do not like typing quotes repeatedly, but if we support both syntax, it can also serve as a good walk-around to the "," not supported issue without compromising ease of use.

Thank you for pointing out this, this undesirable behavior is indeed my neglect. I have corrected it in the latest PR. I have also update the documentation and test accordingly.

I have also updated the supported input format to `"['a','b']"` to solve the `,` cannot be used issue.

### Please confirm that you have searched existing issues in the repo

Yes, I have searched the existing issues

### Any related issues?

This issue is a sub issue of the #2106 

### What is the area that this feature belongs to?

_No response_

### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

As mentioned in #1206, External and ExternalManager components are highly coupled as External depends on ExternalManager and ExternalManger depends on External. This makes adding unit test and coming up with mock on them difficult.

### Describe the solution you'd like

Refactor the code. This is a good first step towards achieve the goal of boosting test coverage to the core components.

Hi; initially I plan to implement a new component called table; 
but (credit to yucheng for pointing out relevant existing features)later I realize that we already could bring csv file as an external virable, and after reading the current code (lib/nunjucks-extension, ver-components/src/panels and html/includePanelProcessor), I do not think I could bring a significant improvement over the current feature.

Adding this to "topic1.md"

<div id="examples" class="d-none">

1 + 1 = 2 &hat;[Math2]

Add this to index.md:

We see:

### Expected behavior

1 footnotes that not visible to users are not rendered?
2 footnotes from include are properly indexed and displayed.

### Anything else?

I feel it is reasonable to fix this first before fixing #2203, as otherwise we are forced to either:
Add weak test case that do not take care of the id of the footnote
or
Add test case that expect to get footnote with wrong ids

Both ways are not ideal.

Another issue of this way of writing is, we do not have a clear idea on the dependency of the sequence of run. 

In future,  we should run every no conflicting async function in parallel, and shift to A.then().then() style to specify sequential dependencies.

> @yiwen101 To facilitate reuse, an outsider should be able to override variables to customize the component to fit her needs (yes, this is the opposite of normal variable overriding). That way, the component can be reused without changing its code.

I see, thanks for the clarification. 
I just noticed that the documentation also specifies that "Global variables (_markbind/variables.md) will take precedence over any variables set via Nunjucks' tags (e.g. ' set ').". This is quite counter intuitive.

I would like to clarify the concept of hydration.
I am working on adding simple rules to detect invalid html structure. One of the rule is that "<p>" tag can not have block level element as children, and it detects that (to my surprise) 404.md violates the rule.

In 404.vue.js:

However, when I do "markbind serve -d" at /docs, I do not experience/see hydration issue. Why is this the case?

After some primitive testing, it seems that current browsers are quite robust. All the issues listed below seems would not cause hydration issue (though may still leads to unexpected behaviours):

However, it seems the not easy to parse an array of string correctly. How do you find the idea of just make do with using "," as separator? eg: ``{`` texts="(a),(b),(c)" ``}`` as prof's initial proposal. This makes parsing much simpler

@ckcherry23 
Thank you for raising this issue up, and the suggestion on better CI.
A quick investigation shows that this problem is first observable after [this depend-bot update pr](https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/pull/2532) that bumps gp-pages from 2.2.0 to 5.0.0.

I do not think the missing tbody issue is related to the "path is undefined" problem we are facing, although there is indeed table without tbody spotted here.

But it does not seem to be causing hydration in the current deployed site.

Interestingly, I also noticed that when I checkout to ba0b92d28, this code that has caused hydration in the past also does not cause hydration locally on my device now.

Thank you for pointing it out. It turns out it is necessary to verify the length of the output. Currently, if I use &lt;m-table>, the length of the output after the selector is 0, leading to a vacuously true situation.

Hi @damithc ,

I updated the plugin and it is now able to support both sorting and filtering. This is all, however, powered by [DataTables](https://datatables.net/), which is a Javascript table library that is loaded from CDN directly. What do you think of the functioinality now? There are additional features like paging and scrolling from DataTable. Are these features needed?

Thanks for your advice.

Hi @damithc ,

Thank you for your input!

Regarding your concern:
1. The syntax for the plugin is that `&lt;m-table sortable searchable>` to enable both features. We may also include only one feature.
2. The plugin appears to be quite popular and active. It is open source under `MIT license`. I have included the minimised js and css in our repo. It should be working fine as long as we are still using Bootstrap5. I guess we can still stick with these js and css files even if they commercialize it?
3. Some other features include paging. But I fell like it is a bit distracting as it wil add page info and agination control. It may be useful if we intend to have a really long table. But I think we already have panel, so it is not a necessary feature.

I do realise that the plugin is not working inside a panel or modal. It seems to suffer the same problem as the mermaid plugin #2052 . I am still investigating this issue.

Hi!

I seem to have made the plugin work in Vue components. 

The original problem is that the DataTables initilization takes place when the page loads. However, when the table is inside a Vue component, the component's rendering process is not done at the time the initialization script runs. As a result, the DataTables initialization cannot find the table elements or properly attach the functionality to them.

The Solution is that I leveraged Vue's custom directives feature. Custom directives allow us to encapsulate DOM manipulations and execute them at specific stages of a component's lifecycle.

1. I defined a custom directive called `v-datatable` using `Vue.directive()`. Inside the directive, I specified an inserted hook, which is called when the directive is inserted into the DOM. In this hook, I initialized DataTables on the element using `$(el).DataTable()`.
2. I updated the `initScript` to include the custom directive definition before the regular DataTables initialization code.
3. In the postRender function, I added the v-datatable directive to the table elements using .attr('v-datatable', ''). This ensures that the custom directive is applied to the tables within the Vue component.

When the Vue component is rendered, the custom directive's inserted hook is triggered for each table element with the `v-datatable` directive. This hook initializes `DataTables` on the table element, ensuring that the functionality is properly attached.

It seems like that the font and emoji related files are also present in other directories, e.g., `test_site`and `test_site_algoloa_plugin`. It appears to me that they are necessary in order for the functional test to be sucessfully run.

Hi @yucheng11122017 ,

I am not quite sure how the scroll bar appears. It appears when I initialised with default template and using consecutive &lt;m-table>. But the scroll bar doesn't not apepar if I do the same thing starting from minimal template.

Since there should never be one, I added additional css to suppress it. It Hopefully this is the right fix.

Hi @yucheng11122017 ,

I think this has to do with how I am adding the functional test. From my observation of the existing convention in MarkBind, plugin related functional tests are placed in a standalone directory like  `test_site_algoloa_plugin`. The font files and emoji files are indeed present in that directory. You may find them under paths like packages/cli/test/functional/test_site_algoloa_plugin/expected/markbind/css/fonts/KaTeX_AMS-Regular.ttf

Hi @yucheng11122017 
It does work like that on my side. But indeed this seems to be undefined behaviors. I will look into this. I will set the PR to draft for now until I thoroughly understand the CSS for the site. Sorry for the overlook.

I have added a `printing optimization` section under the code. I am not too sure about adding a dedicated section about `Printing Optimisation` under reference though. Most optimizations we do seem quite natural and are quite unlikely to cause too much surprise.

I will raise a dedicated PR to add a `Printing Optimisation` section about all the optimizations if it is considered useful and appropriate.

I apologize for any confusion regarding your earlier request. I have now revised the highlight color in the code block to pure black (#000000), as per your specification.

Regarding the update of the CSS files for the documentation and templates, I would like to clarify the process. My understanding is that the CSS files within the `_site` directory are auto-generated. Could you please clarify the steps needed for this integration?

Hi @damithc ,

For the `mermaid` plugin, the external javascript loaded from CDN comes in at 3.3MB and is kind of heavy. It may results in some network costs.

For the `dataTable` plugin, the javascript involved is much lighter. I have not systematically determined the performance overhead though.

I found this [discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2392366/print-background-colours-in-chrome) to be relevant. It appears that adding `-webkit-print-color-adjust:exact;` in the element css will force print the background colour.

```css
    .hljs span.highlighted``{``
        -webkit-print-color-adjust:exact;
        background:#e6e6fa !important;

Alternatively, users can also choose to print background colour themselves in Chrome settings under more settings -&gt; options.

Hi @kaixin-hc ,

This approach works for Safari as well. (Maybe because Safari is also based on WebKit) It doesn't work for Firefox though. From my observations, there seem to have been many other bugs when printing with Firefox. I am not sure if it is necessary to fix them all.

I took a look at the PR and wanted to share a few thoughts on prepending the `variables.md` content to all files before rendering with Nunjucks.

While it might work, there are a few potential downsides to keep in mind:

1. It could impact performance, especially for larger files or projects with many files.
2. If a file already has Nunjucks syntax or comments, I am not sure if prepending the content will lead to conflicts.

Instead of modifying individual files, I also support configuring the Nunjucks environment to load `variables.md` during initialization. That way, the variables will be available to all templates without needing to modify each file.

Another option could be using Nunjucks' `addGlobal` method or creating a separate config file for `VariableRenderer`-specific variables.

Overall, while the proposed solution might work, it goes against the principle of separating concerns. It's generally better to keep variable declarations centralized and configure the rendering environment appropriately for cleaner code organization and maintainability.

> I'm also investigating adding pagefind as a dependency, adding it to the current build process (`index.ts`) so that an index can be created after the site is built. However, I'm having issues importing the NodeJS API package. Currently Pagefind's npm interface only supports being used as an ESM module via `import`, rather than as a CJS package through `require`. So `import * as pagefind from 'pagefind'` would be acceptable, but `const pagefind = require('pagefind')` would result in the following error:

From my perspectives, the Pull Request is on the right track to bring in `Pagefind`.

I think to ensure TypeScript configuration is set up to output ESM code, you can modify the `tsconfig.json` file to include the following options:
`````{``json``}``
``{``
  "compilerOptions": ``{``
    // ... other options ...
    "module": "esnext",
    "moduleResolution": "node"
  ``}``
``}``
```

Title: Broken Link to Emoticon Shortcuts in User Guide Documentation

Description:
We have identified a broken hyperlink in the "Emoji" subsection of the "Formatting Content" section within the MarkBind User Guide. The issue lies with the link directed to the "emoticon shortcuts," which currently points to an obsolete address.

Specifically, the link in question ([https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it-emoji/blob/master/lib/data/shortcuts.js](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it-emoji/blob/master/lib/data/shortcuts.js)) is intended to direct users to the JavaScript file containing emoji shortcuts used by the markdown-it-emoji plugin. However, this file has recently been renamed, changing its suffix from `.js` to `.mjs`. Consequently, the existing link is no longer valid, leading to a 404 error page.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Navigate to the MarkBind User Guide, specifically to the "Formatting Content" section.
2. Scroll to the "Emoji" subsection.
3. Click on the link provided for "emoticon shortcuts."
4. Observe that the link directs to a non-existent page on GitHub, indicating a 404 error.

### Expected behavior

_No response_

### Anything else?

The resolution involves a simple update: I will submit a Pull Request to change the hyperlink's suffix from `.js` to `.mjs`.

An alternative approach is to include the page directly in our repository for self-containment. However, this could increase the repository's size. The choice between updating the link and incorporating the page into our repository depends on balancing immediate access against potential repository bloat.

### Please confirm that you have searched existing issues in the repo

### What is the area that this feature belongs to?

Performance, Plugins

### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

Currently, the `mermaid` and `datatables` plugins are not activated by default. The arguments are that the performance overhead brought in is not negligible:

1. For the mermaid plugin (#2475), the external javascript loaded from CDN comes in at 3.3MB and is kind of heavy. It may result in some network costs.
1. For the dataTable plugin (#2446), the javascript involved is much lighter. The performance overhead, however, is not thoroughly investigated.

However, such a configuration is contradictory to our wishes that 'everything works out of the box'. This issue is the umbrella issue to call for investigation on the performance overhead of the plugins and efforts to make the plugins default.

### Describe the solution you'd like

It is suggested by Prof. Damith that we can load the javascript libraries on demand. This is possible with modifications to the backend (site build) code.

### Describe alternatives you've considered

Professor Damith remarked in the discussion that he is open to retaining the feature as it could enhance the production of printer-friendly page versions. Given that the capability to print the page-navigation has been successfully implemented (as evidenced by Pull Request #2069), the continued use of markdown-it-table-of-contents seems superfluous.

I am currently working on a baseline implementation that puts ASciidoc tables in a special tag like `&lt;table-pro>`. It will then be processed by a plugin that works similarly to the `PlantUML` support. Users will have to download `Asciidoctor` first and then the plugin will use `Asciidoctor` to generate HTML from the Asciidoc syntax.

As discussed with Prof. Damith, the two features of priority would be:
1. Making table sortable.
2. Adding filtering functionality.

More specifically, filtering refers to having a search bar for the table. A specific use case would be the student progress page for CS2103/T.

It seems that the updates in the commit titled 'Add commit animation when closing panel with bottom switch (#2340)' by @yucheng11122017 have altered the behavior.

Adding Intellij IDEA like indention-aware code wrapping can be quite hard. A pure CSS approach may not be viable due to the nature of how whitespace is handled in HTML and CSS. Current logic in markdown-it does not involve indentation. We might have to work on the parser there. I am looking to extend `markdownIt.renderer.rules.fence` to support 

A naive soft wrapping preserves the original line breaks and spaces but does not add additional indentation to each wrapped line.
<img width="995" alt="Screenshot 2024-02-05 at 13 01 46" src="https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/assets/61866948/ea22ed2b-4f5b-4284-8c2d-6b52368228a9">

I propose modifying `markdown-it` to wrap each line of code from the original markdown in an HTML element with a distinct CSS class. When processing each line of a code block, calculate the indentation level (e.g., the number of spaces or tabs at the beginning of the line) and set it as a CSS variable on the element wrapping that line. We can utilize CSS custom properties to dynamically adjust the indentation based on the content.

Sample HTML output from `markdown-it` (irrelevant details ignored):
```html
<pre>
<span class="code-line" style="--indent-size: 0px;">function example() ``{``</span>
<span class="code-line" style="--indent-size: 20px;">console.log("Hello, world!");</span>
<span class="code-line" style="--indent-size: 0px;">``}``</span>
</pre>
```

Example CSS: 
```css
.code-line ``{``
  display: inline-block;
  white-space: pre-wrap; /* Allow wrapping */
  --indent-size: 0px; /* Default indentation size */
  margin-left: var(--indent-size); /* Apply indentation */
``}``
```

Thank you for the observation. This indeed appears to be the perfect solution. To move forward with this, we can:

1. Make code soft-wrapping the bottom default setting, instead of offering it merely as a plugin. This ensures all users automatically benefit from better readability without the need for manual activation.
2. Apply code soft-wrapping when printing, ensuring that the printed is complete.
3. Automatically use line numbers with soft-wrapped code, even if not specifically enabled by the user. 

I will raise a PR to implement these changes.

Hi, I've had to change the linting rules for unused variables to use the one built for typescript because it was creating false positives. Thank you!

### What feature(s) would you like to see in RepoSense
Add a feature that allows users to display only the part of the summary chart where the user has been active.

### Is the feature request related to a problem?
For example, if a student worked on project A for 6 weeks, and then worked on project B for 6 weeks, currently there would be a sizeable amount of blank space for the latter half of project A and earlier half of project B. 

### If applicable, describe alternatives you've considered
An alternate solution as described in #1431 is to instead allow the user to specify the display time range for each summary chart.

### Additional context

In line with keeping PRs small and working on issues incrementally, I have decided to stop working on the implementation of `FailableOptional` for now and limit this PR to a proof of concept / potential implementation of the `Optional` alternatives we can use.

@gok99 Instead of compositing types like that, perhaps we could store exceptions thrown in a list in a failed instance instead? Every time the `FailableOptional` is mapped, the exceptions are carried over into the mapped instance instead? A special map function could also be used to add on new possibly unhandled exceptions too:

e.g.
```java
@Override
public <U> FailableOptional<U> tryWith(ThrowingFunction<T, U, E> function, Exception ex) ``{``
    // if failed, add ex to thrown exception list, replicate it on new instance of fail?
    return new Fail<>(this.thrownExceptionsList, ex);
``}``
```

One of the problems with this is that I cannot retreive Class information from Generic types, so I would need users to specify the exception class that can be thrown explicitly in order to save it.

@gok99 I see, so far, I don't really think that there is much use passing in exceptions for checks as of yet; most of our functions that can benefit from FailableOptional appears to only throw once, rendering the saving of Exceptions rather meaningless.

I will look into the above recommendations that you have provided on the Scala ZIO monad, and update this PR with new code/findings!

@gok99 I have implemented a new `Failable` monad which is largely based on Scala's ZIO.

There are some compromises that need to be made:

1. "Reflective" access is required to assert the type of exception thrown by any of the `Throwable*` interface is indeed of the correct type (though I'm not so sure about this, perhaps you could advise me more on how I can achieve this? I could do an unchecked cast from the Throwable type catch to the generic type, which should be safe enough in principle since the type is already declared by the `Throwable*` interfaces)

```java
private static <T, E extends Throwable> Failable<T, E> ifFailElseThrow(Throwable throwable) ``{``
    if (new Fail<>(throwable).getExceptionClass().isInstance(throwable)) ``{``
        @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
        Failable<T, E> failed = (Failable<T, E>) new Fail<>(throwable);
        return failed;
    ``}``

    throw new ClassCastException("Exception class does not match specifications");
``}``
```

2. When a failed instance is `flatMap`-ed, there is an implicit assumption that the user knows that the type of exception stored within the instance is of the original exception type and that the `flatmap` should not change the exception type into something that is not a subclass of the original exception type. We could restrict the type of exceptions thrown by functions used for `flatmap`-ping to exceptions that are subclasses of the original exception type, and permit exception type changes only with the `failWith` method (which requires users to specify the exception instance to replace the one stored in the class), but I would like to hear your opinion on this.

```java
public <U, Z extends Throwable> Failable<U, Z> flatMap(
        ThrowableFunction<? super T, ? extends Failable<? extends U, Z>, Z> throwableFunction) ``{``
    return Failable.ifFailElseThrow(this.exception);
``}``
```

There is a non-throwing version of `flatMap` that uses Java's functional interface `Function`, but I am not sure if this alone would suffice.

@gok99 Reflective access was previously required to ensure that the functions that users define can only throw the declared type or subtype of exceptions. However, upon further testing, I realised that the function isn't working as intended; all exceptions are instances of Throwable and hence no exceptions are thrown.

For now, flatmap requires users to not throw incompatible types of exception in the methods. Union types are not available in Java 11 (union types are only available in Java 17 through the sealed interface feature, but even then it does not offer the same kind of type unionisation that we need for our use case), and using [tuple types](https://www.baeldung.com/java-tuples) seems viable for maintaining type safety, but it does seem rather clunky and does not appear to offer type safety if you wish to obtain a stored value. I could explore it if you wish, and report back with any findings that I may have.

But in the meantime, perhaps we could restrict flatmap to only map to the same exception type, and require users to explicitly define a new exception type if necessary?

@gok99 After some preliminary testing and profiling, it seems that the refactoring does not have much of an impact on the overall performance of the code. The increases or decreases may likely be the result of randomness when executing the program. Here are the findings:

**Time**

* Before refactor: 6079ms
* After refactor: 5820ms

**Space**

* Before refactor: 857.902 MB
* After refactor: 862.132 MB

These findings were made before we consolidated Regex patterns into one single class to avoid duplication, hence results may vary later on.

@gok99 @chan-j-d Apologies for the late reply, but thank you for your feedback and comments! I agree with @gok99 in that this may be rather troublesome to maintain, and perhaps we should make our builders explicitly one-use only. I also agree with @chan-j-d in that it would require constant updates to `clone` should we decide to modify `RepoConfiguration` and any of its dependent classes sometime in the future, complicating maintenance and hampering the extensibility of our code.

After reviewing the codebase, I too realise that cascading cloning offers little benefit to the overall efficiency of the codebase; perhaps we could look into how we can make some of the crucial classes immutable instead, choosing to minimise side effects rather than explicitly implementing `Cloneable` and forcing developers to call a potentially throwing function `clone`? I believe one of the other initial goal of implementing`Cloneable` was to also minimise side effects and prevent users from accidentally or intentionally altering the contents of a crucial object during runtime. Not sure if this is something that we should look into, but I would love to hear your thoughts on this!

@gok99 Perhaps we could first take a look at how we can make our model classes immutable before we take a look at the other classes. I believe the model classes would be the easiest (and with minimal impacts on the entire codebase) classes to refactor first.

Sure! The main motivation behind resetting the Builder object on every `build` operation is to prevent aliasing issues when the user chooses to rebuild `CliArguments` multiple times. Since the cloning operation has not been implemented yet, we decided that the temporary fix would be to reset the Builder object on every build.

A new issue has been released which aims to tackle this issue and to allow duplication of `CliArguments` to avoid resetting the Builder object on every build. I am working on it and will release the PR sometime this coming week!

Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I would like to clarify if you meant something like this:

```java
public static class Builder ``{``
    ...
    private RepoConfiguration repoConfig;

    public Builder() ``{``
        this.repoConfig = new RepoConfiguration();
    ``}``

    ...

    public Builder branch(String branch) ``{``
        // set*() methods should be private
        this.repoConfig.setBranch(branch);
        return this;
    ``}``

    public RepoConfiguration build() ``{``
        return this.repoConfig;
    ``}``
``}``
```

If so, I believe that this might unintentionally result in aliasing issues. Since the builder pattern allows us to build on existing builder objects to create new configurations or reuse old configurations, the `build` method may unintentionally return the reference to the same `RepoConfiguration` object in memory, regardless of what configurations have been previously applied to the `Builder` object before.

This might violate the builder pattern since the `build` method is supposed to return a new `RepoConfiguration` if the builder configurations are modified, but now it only returns the reference to the latest modified `RepoConfiguration` object, and all previous `RepoConfiguration` references now point to the latest modified `RepoConfiguration` (all previously built `RepoConfiguration` are "forgotten").

@gok99 Just a tiny update, I have gone ahead and tried to implement your suggestion by converting the constructor for `RepoConfiguration` into a copy constructor, and created a private empty constructor for `RepoConfiguration` (for use within the `Builder` class).

So far, I managed to remove most of the duplicated variable names within the `Builder` class, spare for the `displayName`, `repoFolderName` and `outputFolderName`, as they are needed for the changing of the names during the actual build step for `Builder`, however, I am looking at implementing flags within `Builder` instead to track if the user has made any modifications to these names, and stop the default action (which is to process the default names for the repo and tag on extra information to it) from taking place.

EDIT: I have updated the PR with the necessary edits, so sorry for not updating the PR beforehand!

@gok99 Can I also check if it is fine to set default values for some of the parameters? I realised from previous code that the constructors chain their calls and set default values for certain fields if they are not provided. I was wondering if it is ok to leave it as it is for now, and check that `RepoLocation` is minimally provided by the user?

The current checks that I had implemented relate to the parameters used in the constructors of the old code, which might not be all too helpful especially when default values for some fields are set (hence they will always be populated and not null).

Regarding the first point, I have mostly converted the null checks into Optional checks, hopefully making the code much more readable and understandable by abstracting away the logic. I have also moved the construction of the name over into the builder class.

Regarding the second point, I have modified the `build` method accordingly and utilised the copy constructor along with the resetting of the built `RepoConfiguration` object within the builder after it is done building. I realise that this might impact the reusability of the builder objects, but as we are not reusing builder objects anywhere as mentioned previously, this should be fine for now.

I have also made some changes to the way the `processName` and `processOrganisation` works, whereby if specified by `RepoBuilder`, the folder name, output folder name and display name will change to the one that is provided by `RepoBuilder`, rather than defaulting to the default names given to those 3 variables.

I believe that this was an oversight on my part and I had failed to implement checks and allow `RepoBuilder` configurations to override the default configuration.

This behaviour should be fixed now in the new commit!

Should we declare a `Pattern` object before the `for` loop and subsequently use the declared `Pattern` object to obtain a `Matcher` object to split the string?

Sorry for the delayed response, but if I'm not mistaken, any time where Regex operations are used directly without `Matcher` or `Pattern` causes the creation of one `Matcher` or `Pattern` object, since these operations use the 2 classes to execute the Regex task.

In the case that you have outlined, I believe we can treat it as multiple `Pattern` and `Matcher` objects being created throughout the loop.

Would it be possible to declare a `Pattern(DIFF_FILE_CHUNK_SEPARATOR)` object at the class level, and subsequently reused by the different methods for the various Regex operations within the nested function calls?

### What feature(s) would you like to see in RepoSense
&gt;!--
  Provide a clear and concise description of the feature.
-->

Currently, some areas of RepoSense use Regex checks within iterations.

For example, consider `StringsUtil::filterText`.

```java
public static String filterText(String text, String regex) ``{``
    String[] split = text.split("\n");
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    for (String line: split) ``{``
        if (line.matches(regex)) ``{``
            sb.append(line + "\n");
        ``}``
    ``}``

    return sb.toString();
``}``
```

As observed, the method `String::matches` is called for as many times as there are lines in the input text, which is not performant as `String::matches` creates and compiles a new Regex pattern every time it is called. This behaviour is evident in the [source code](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-jdk11/blob/master/src/java.base/share/classes/java/lang/String.java) for the `String::matches` method, which makes a call to `Pattern.matches(regex, string)`.

It is recommended by the documentation for the [`Pattern` class](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html) as well as some [external sources](https://raygun.com/blog/java-performance-optimization-tips/#:~:text=Use%20compiled%20regular%20expressions%3A%20One,Pattern%20class%20for%20this%20purpose.) to avoid such a pattern of code since it causes many unnecessary Regex compilations, which takes more time and consumes more memory.

After implementing some fixes for this behaviour, and from some preliminary profiling using Intellij's built-in Java Profiler, I have observed that the improvements lead to a small decrease in runtime and a significant decrease in memory usage when Regex patterns are precompiled first before being used in a `for` loop.

Here are some of my findings:

**Command used to test**

```
./gradlew run -Dargs="--repos https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense.git https://github.com/CATcher-org/CATcher.git https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind.git --output ./report_folder --since 31/1/2017 --formats java adoc xml --view --ignore-standalone-config --last-modified-date --timezone UTC+08 --find-previous-authors"

Some key points to note:

* **43.32%** (!) decrease in memory usage
* It also appears that `StreamGobbler` consumes a significant chunk of memory, perhaps we could also look into reducing the memory usage of that class?

---

**Limitations**

* These preliminary profiling tasks are done on a M1 Mac with MacOS. These performance values may vary across different OS and processors
* Only 3 profiling samples were taken, more samples might have to be taken, across multiple platforms and processors, to decide if these enhancements have a positive impact on the performance of RepoSense

This feature is not exactly related to a particular problem in general, but it is linked to the overall goal of increasing RepoSense's performance and memory usage.

### If possible, describe the solution

&gt;!--
  Here would be a good place to talk about the solution or the
  approach that can be taken.

The solution involves the pre-compilation of the offending Regex pattern into a `Pattern` object, and using a `Matcher` object created from `Pattern` to test if the string matches the Regex pattern.

The fixes are found in a draft PR [here](https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/pull/2092).

### What feature(s) would you like to see in RepoSense

As detailed in issue #2091, the `StreamGobbler` class consumes a large amount of memory when in use, upwards of around > 500 MB per run. 

After some digging around through the codebase, and looking through the different source codes for `String` and `StringBuilder` class, it appears that there might be some performance bottlenecks with the way that the code is currently written.

Currently, the code is implemented as such:

```java
ReadableByteChannel ch = Channels.newChannel(is);
int len;
while ((len = ch.read(buffer)) > 0) ``{``
    sb.append(new String(buffer.array(), 0, len));
    buffer.rewind();
``}``
value = sb.toString();
```

We can observe that a new `String` is created for every 8 KB of data read into the buffer and that the string is subsequently appended with the other strings stored in `StringBuilder` before the buffer is rewound and overwritten in the next file read operation.

After reading through the `String` API, I noticed that the creation of a new string from the buffer array possibly creates a new copy of the array with `Arrays::copyOf` or `Arrays::copyOfRange` within the `StringCoding` class, which handles the decoding of `String` objects.

Moreover, the String appending process for `StringBuilder` could possibly make a call to the `AbstractStringBuilder::getBytes` method, which makes another call to `System::arraycopy`.

The combination of both method calls means that repeated work may have been done, first to copy the byte buffer into the byte array contained in a `String`, and thereafter to copy the byte array in the `String` out into the internal byte array of `StringBuilder`. 

This repeated work, as well as the creation of multiple `String` objects (which could be problematic when the files are huge, since each `String` object can only contain at most 8 KB of data from the file), could result in a significant decrease in runtime performance (also possibly from garbage collection) and an increase in (heap) memory usage.

We could look into finding new ways to read all data in an input stream and avoid repeated work to improve both runtime and memory performance.

  Provide a clear and concise description of what the problem is.

This issue is not related to a problem, but it is related to the overall goal of making RepoSense more performant.

### If possible, describe the solution

&gt;!--
  Here would be a good place to talk about the solution or the
  approach that can be taken.
-->

Currently, I am unable to find a solution that works sufficiently well. Improving memory performance necessarily means that runtime performance would degrade and vice versa.

Some resources that we might wish to take a look at would be [this](https://www.baeldung.com/convert-input-stream-to-string). I have tried out using `BufferedReader` from the guide and it seems to reduce the overall runtime and memory usage but it seems that it is occasionally failing test cases and system test cases.

Here is the result of one of the profiling runs:

<img width="850" alt="Screenshot 2024-01-23 at 7 05 16 PM" src="https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/assets/73705042/9cc154f1-2ecf-45a1-8a89-911ef2dae6b8">

The overall runtime and memory usage were lower compared to the improvements made in #2091.

The code tested is as follow:

```java
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

try (BufferedReader streamReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(is))) ``{``
    int c;

    while ((c = streamReader.read()) != -1) ``{``
        sb.append((char) c);
    ``}``

    value = sb.toString();
``}``
```

### What feature(s) would you like to see in RepoSense

Currently, the way the Java files are organised within the `parser` package is not very neat, with the Exception and Type classes being located on the same level as the Parser classes.

This does not follow how the other classes in the other packages are being organised, with Exception and Model classes being moved into their separate sub-packages.

### What feature(s) would you like to see in RepoSense
&lt;!--
  Provide a clear and concise description of the feature.
-->

Currently, `CliArguments`' Builder patterns is not in line with how `RepoConfiguration`'s Builder pattern was implemented.

As observed in PR #2078, the Builder objects in the codebase are not being reused, and the Builder pattern was adopted as a way to reduce constructor complexity and increase flexibility in how we as developers can construct `RepoConfiguration` or `CliArguments` objects. The current implementation of the Builder pattern for `CliArguments` assumes that `Builder` objects will be reused, but since this is not the case for most parts of the codebase, refactoring the `Builder` class might be beneficial for reducing duplication of class attributes and for increasing overall code equality.

We could look into refactoring `CliArguments` in such a way that it conforms to `RepoConfiguration`'s implementation of the Builder pattern.

We can adopt the variation of the Builder pattern as detailed in #2078, by simplifying the Builder objects by storing an instance of `CliArguments` within the `Builder` object, and building into that instance directly, reducing attribute duplication.

Currently, both Builder patterns implemented in `RepoConfiguration` and `CliArguments` are implemented in such a way that the `Builder` objects are one-use and cannot be reused to build new instances of `RepoConfiguration` and `CliArguments`.

This is not ideal since this prevents us from reusing `Builder` instances to construct duplicate instances of `RepoConfiguration` or `CliArguments`, which violates the Builder pattern and incurs an overhead if we would like to construct duplicate copies of `RepoConfiguration` or `CliArguments`.

We could change the codebase in such a way that classes used in `RepoConfiguration` and `CliArguments`, as well as `RepoConfiguration` and `CliArguments`, implement the [`Cloneable`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Cloneable.html) interface and provide an implementation of the `clone()` method to allow for easier duplication and cloning of `RepoConfiguration` and `CliArguments` instances.

@gok99 I have provided a proof of concept for the `clone` feature in the draft PR linked to this issue, for your reference.

I agree that allowing deep cloning would introduce a significant amount of boilerplate code (as seen in the draft PR, with the different classes implementing the `Cloneable::clone()` method to allow cloning of `RepoConfiguration` and `CliArguments`. It might also incur additional performance/memory overhead through the creation of multiple referenced objects on the heap.

I'm not too sure where Builders can be reused efficiently at the moment; the only place I am certain would help would be the test cases (test cases can reuse base Builder objects to create more complex objects, reducing the amount of code needed to execute the test cases), but implementing such a drastic feature just for a slight improvement in memory use for unit testing might not be worth the increase in bloat and complexity of the codebase coupled with the increase in code quality...

### What feature(s) would you like to see in RepoSense
&lt;!--
  Provide a clear and concise description of the feature.
-->

Previously, due to the constructors used in `RepoConfiguration` and `CliArguments`, only legal combinations of parameters were permitted in the construction of `RepoConfiguration` and `CliArguments` objects.

However, with the Builder pattern, this restriction in parameter combination is lifted, and hence there is a need to validate if the combination of provided parameters is legal.

### Is the feature request related to a problem?

&lt;!--

-->

### If possible, describe the solution

&lt;!--
  Here would be a good place to talk about the solution or the
  approach that can be taken.
-->

We should first ascertain the legal parameter combinations for both `RepoConfiguration` and `CliArguments`, before implementing a method such as `validate()` to check if the provided parameters follow some established legal combination of parameters, before the `Builder` object builds the `RepoConfiguration` or `CliArguments` object.

### If applicable, describe alternatives you've considered

&lt;!--
  Let us know about other solutions you've tried or researched.
-->

One alternative we could consider would be providing documentation on what parameter combinations are valid, and explicitly warning users that deviations from these combinations may result in errors. This puts the burden of correctness on the user, and it assumes that the users are knowledgeable enough to know what combinations of parameters they would require to get their work done.

Alternatively, we could ascertain that certain mandatory parameters that the user is required to fill in are indeed filled in, and leverage the existing default values currently in use to ensure that other required parameters, if omitted, have a default value to fall back on if necessary.

### What feature(s) would you like to see in RepoSense
&lt;!--
  Provide a clear and concise description of the feature.
-->

Currently, we are facing issues regarding the standardisation of tests for both the frontend and backend.

Considering that there is a wide range of possible combinations of dependencies that need to be tested to ensure a consistent look and performance across all platforms, the use of a containerisation framework such as [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) would help accelerate our current workflows and increase the overall coverage of our tests.

Moreover, Docker provides us with a new way to help our users who are facing dependency issues, since the dependencies and codebase are bundled and abstracted away from the user, who just needs to use Docker to run RepoSense without worrying if the dependencies would cause issues for them.

This would also allow us to more confidently upgrade our existing dependencies while providing support for older dependencies through older, backwards-compatible builds of RepoSense.

For the more tech-savvy users or admins, the introduction of Docker containers provides them with a way to use other container orchestration tools such as Kubernetes to better manage multiple running instances of RepoSense on their cloud/web services, increasing the overall availability of RepoSense for their target users.

Docker integrates nicely with Github Actions [(more here)](https://docs.docker.com/build/ci/github-actions/) and can be easily orchestrated using Docker Compose, allowing us to create multiple Docker containers and store them on Github Packages or Docker Hub, or to use it for mainly testing purposes using Github Actions.

There are also ways for the Docker CLI to accept new parameters at the CLI during execution and to pass them to the Docker container, mimicking how our existing CLI commands work. We can also mount a user's local file system into the Docker container so that they can view and analyse any other local repositories on their local file system, maintaining RepoSense's key selling points and features.

### Is the feature request related to a problem?

&lt;!--
  Provide a clear and concise description of what the problem is.
  Ex. I have an issue when [...]
-->

The use of Docker might help resolve current issues related to frontend and backend testing issues, as well as issues related to dependency clashes.

### If possible, describe the solution

&lt;!--
  Here would be a good place to talk about the solution or the
  approach that can be taken.
-->

We could look into integrating Docker into our codebase and workflows, by creating `Dockerfile`s and `docker-compose` files, and experiment with how we can most efficiently pass in parameters from the Docker CLI into the Docker containers, as well as how we can mount our local file systems into the Docker containers we create and run.

### If applicable, describe alternatives you've considered

&lt;!--
  Let us know about other solutions you've tried or researched.
-->

This feature might prove to be another dependency that we need to resolve now since we have to ensure that the Docker containers we generate and upload would be the most up-to-date version and that there could be multiple Docker containers at any time with differing dependencies for different user groups.

This might prove to be more cumbersome than leaving things as it is right now.

I am currently looking into just Ubuntu/Linux distros for now as the testing bed for the new Docker changes.

The results are looking promising so far, however, there are some challenges that I have faced so far:

- Running Gradle's `systemTest` after `test` seems to cause something to break, so for now I am using `build` instead to test if RepoSense will compile
- MacOS do not offer Docker containers of the OS, and a 3rd party image `Docker-OSX` is being explored as a replacement for it (though I am also having some issues regarding that too (trying to copy over RepoSense and having it execute in the MacOS container, downloading `brew` and `nvm`, etc.)
- I cannot test Windows containers directly since M1 macs are not supported (only x86 chips are supported, which shouldn't be much of a problem since Github's runners are x86)

Will keep everyone posted about the updates via this thread.

As discussed, there is minimal benefit that Docker might offer in terms of optimising our current testing/deployment workflow. As such, we are abandoning the use of Docker and updating Github Actions instead to make it more robust for different versions of Java and Node.

-->

The current language support on which our codebase is written is based on Java 8. However, we should look into migrating to Java 11 LTS for better security, features and APIs.

**EDIT:** After checking the API documentation, it appears that the `HttpServer` implementation introduced in JDK 11 is part of the `com.sun` package, which is discouraged from use due to the JRE-specific implementation of these packages, meaning that users of other JREs other than `openjdk` may not be able to use it without breaking. As such, it might not be prudent to change the existing HTTP server packages that we are using right now for the new, implementation-specific HTTP server internal package offered by the JDK.

This part is a bit strange (the need to calculate an offset) because of the way the refs are stored for summary-chart. Basically, there are multiple groups and in each group, multiple repos. But the number X in the ref for `summary-chart-X` refers to the index of the repo in the individual group. This means that in each ref, there is actually an array of div elements from multiple groups. I didn't want to change the way the refs were stored since the iframe feature seems to depend on it

using `.scrollIntoView(``{`` behavior: 'smooth', block: 'nearest' ``}``)` works well enough for this, but the element will not end up in the centre of the screen. it seems there is a `.scrollIntoViewIfNeeded` method but it's non-standard and not supported by firefox. maybe we can implement a much simpler version of [this polyfill](https://gist.github.com/hsablonniere/2581101)? let me know what you think!

@damithc thanks prof for this! with further discussion with @ckcherry23, i decided it was best to not change/add too many unnecessary and confusing features. to keep it simple, i made it such that the active repo (pressing the &lt;/> or list icon) will be scrolled to automatically, even on refresh. let me know what you think!

@damithc the original behaviour was that pressing either the list or code icon would highlight the repo and the commit/code panel would appear on the right. this PR makes it such that highlighting the repo would also cause it to be in focus if it's not within view (thanks @ckcherry23 for this suggestion!). this would mostly happen if the user reloads the page or reopens the link somehow (so the page will automatically scroll to the highlighted repo).

@ckcherry23 i added a cypress test, but for some reason the test seems flaky - the scroll in the cypress window seems to randomly stop at the div before the highlighted one and sometimes it works fine. manually testing this behaviour outside of cypress, this issue seems to never occur. for now, i added some retries to the flaky test. if possible, could you help me see if this flaky behaviour can be replicated on your end? meanwhile i will continue investigating!

@ckcherry23 thank you for helping investigate this!! i think the least complicated way to fix this issue is to just remove the `behavior: 'smooth'` from `scrollIntoView(``{`` behavior: 'smooth', block: 'nearest' ``}``)` - the scrollBehaviour is not attached to any dom element, so i imagine it would be quite complicated to disable smooth scrolling just for cypress. since the smooth scrolling is just an cosmetic effect, i don't think we will lose too much just removing it?

@vvidday thanks for pointing this out! a very simple fix for most of these tests would like you suggested to remove the `.should('be.visible')` assertion in the tests, but i'm not sure if this is the right way to fix them? the assertion doesn't seem to be doing much as the test would already fail if the element cannot be found. another way could be to scroll down so that the elements are visible

@sopa301 Thanks for the suggestions! I decided to go with the exist assertion because it's an easier change (and also `.click()` will automatically scroll once the exist assertion passes). I also renamed `zoomView_rampChart.js` to `zoomView_rampChart.cy.js` so that the test actually appears

Just added the comment and some test cases! For checked file types, I added some tests to make sure it was testing the last file type to appear in the URL (yml) as that was what was being affected by the bug. Also added some non exhaustive test cases for the code panel options including one for authorshipFileGlob that is most likely the cause for #2058 and #1987. Let me know if I should add more/change anything!

@ckcherry23 @damithc thank you for your comments! will do the necessary changes asap.

as for when we are grouping by repos, it shouldn't be too difficult to make the timeline consistent across a group (i think we can just select the minimum and maximum commit date of the group instead of the user). i'm ok to implement either option!

i think "trim timeline" works!

Not sure if this is strictly necessary, but you might want to put both FileReader instantiations in the try () block so that they will automatically close. Otherwise, LGTM!

### What feature(s) would you like to see in RepoSense
&lt;!--
  Provide a clear and concise description of the feature.
-->
Particularly in large dashboards such as those for CS2103/T, it's easy to get lost within the number of repos displayed by RepoSense. 

### If possible, describe the solution

&lt;!--
  Here would be a good place to talk about the solution or the
  approach that can be taken.
-->

Let's add a new hash to the URL that indicates a repo/author to highlight and scroll to. This is useful for customising a link to send to a CS2103/T team, for example, making it so that the student doesn't need to Ctrl+F to find their own team's repo.

### If applicable, describe alternatives you've considered

&lt;!--
  Let us know about other solutions you've tried or researched.
-->

One other discussed solution was pinning a repo to the top that would not be affected by sorting/filtering. One issue among others brought up with this alternative was that it unnecessary complicates the UI of the page.

@ckcherry23 I just investigated this and think I found what is causing the bug. How should I reopen a PR for this fix - should I push to the same branch as I did originally and keep the commit message the same (including the fact that it includes a bug fix)?

Just investigating for a bit, this might be caused by the ramp shrinking as time goes on (since the until date is not set, defaults to today).

For now, I managed to fix this by setting "until" in the filters to an arbitrary time in the past before this problem arose (I chose 31/12/2023)

Closed because I don't have the required competencies (as of now) to properly fix the issue. Here are some things I learned in the process.

- Updating Node to 18 requires [node-sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass) to be updated to at least 8.0
- However, node-sass has been [depreciated](https://sass-lang.com/blog/libsass-is-deprecated/) in favor of dart-sass (sass), which is already used in the project.
- Additionally, node-sass on windows has a few more [requirements](https://github.com/sass/node-sass#install) that make it harder to set up.
- Therefore, it would be easier to remove node-sass and use sass exclusively.
- Attempting to do so resulted in a bug similar to #1784

Thanks for pointing that out! I went to look at how the colours are generated (in `c-authorship.vue`) and it turns out that the first 10 colours are consistently chosen, while the 11th onward is randomly generated. I'll amend the code since we're only testing the first two colours.

I've also looked at #1613 suggesting snapshot testing, but I have a few concerns. For example, there may be differences between systems that make snapshots unreliable.

Here's a sample report from dashboard #2137 (The relevant commit history is taken from Jor, testrepo-Delta):

Perhaps this points to a deeper bug, but I've opted to stay away from this solution for now. If anyone has an idea of what's causing or how to fix this, do let me know!

Honestly, I have no clue if this try-catch does anything with regard to common problems, because the common problems are handled within the code itself (e.g. missing file is handled by `response.ok` check and markdown doesn't have invalid syntax). It's just to catch freaky errors in I/O that can crash the app, which I'm really not familiar with. Perhaps I could just display the error as a text in the title component, since it's likely that the generated report won't be used if there's an error in the title?

I was thinking it that we could give the user complete freedom on the styling of their title component, but if we're primarily using this as a header for text, I do agree that the margins would make it look better.

I agree that it's an issue and I've been unable to find a satisfactory solution to this. One thing Prof suggested was to disable panel scrolling until the title is removed from view, which was implemented, but I've been unable to resolve the double scrolling, without resorting to tricks like attempting to disable scrolling in one direction.

Would it be possible to disable title scrolling at the parts where panel scrolling is enabled, except at a certain transition point? Maybe that would cause more bugs?

I was initially thinking to enable both scrolling at the point where the title is out of view and either panel is at its top, but it wouldn't fix the scrolling and UX issues. 

At this point, I agree it's probably better to just confine the panel to the left panel. I'll amend the PR to try this.

Currently, the content is obtained by looking for a `title.md` file in the `markdown` folder. I can rewrite it in the way that is suggested to give more flexibility.

Regarding prof @damithc 's query of how it looks:
Input file (an excerpt of the RepoSense README):
![image](https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/assets/96387349/ff0336eb-723a-4bc5-babd-9f288792706d)

The rest of the report can be accessed by scrolling down and the title can be removed from view by scrolling down.

Unfortunately I don't have a way to provide a live preview now. Also there's a bug in the tests, so the github preview doesn't work. I can show it to you in person next monday if I don't solve the bug by then. If someone knows of another way to host a preview do let me know!

If the title.md is empty, the report will look the same as before. I forgot to handle the case where the file is missing, but I think I'll rewrite the code to account for this scenario.

> @sopa301 Would it be possible to add tests for the title component?

I can implement some tests to check for correct handling of exceptions. I think this would be a good time to try to integrate Jest since this component needs to handle negative cases and needs unit testing.

On the other hand, I don't think testing the markdown itself should be necessary, right?

I have discussed this with Prof @damithc and he suggested allowing raw HTML so that we can do styling with the `md` file. The security risks might be reasonable because the users will host their own reports, so they will have full control over what they insert into the title. I have enabled it for now.

@ckcherry23 Thank you for the review! I'm thinking using Array&lt;T> for all Vue files is more consistent and enforceable, but I can change only the defineComponent code if needed. Or we could go with `Array as PropType&lt;T[]>`. I'll try to check if the latter is enforceable via eslint.

Googling a bit suggests that this appending of `#/` is caused by Vue's [Hash Mode](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/essentials/history-mode), which appends a `#` followed by the route `/` (the default one) at the end of the URL. This could be a regression from the implementation of Vue Router.

I tested this using the 2324S1 CS2103T RepoSense dashboard using the default view. Some evidence for this hypothesis:

- Using `#/widget` gives a different view of the webpage.
- Using `#/test` gives a blank webpage

That said, the current fix is good enough to make it work. I propose 2 possible paths in the future:

1. Rewrite the code to ensure Vue Router's internal routing is finished and the URL is fixed before it is processed by `api.ts` (not recommended due to complexity, but could become necessary if we want to keep Vue router from coupling with the internal logic)
2. Refactor `api.ts` to capture this consideration more distinctly.

We can either use the `exist` [assertion](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/assertions) or we can use [`scrollIntoView`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/scrollIntoView) as you mentioned. I think it would be better to use `scrollIntoView` because it would more closely follow an actual user's interaction.

Thanks @asdfghjkxd for consolidating the patterns! Do you have any data on the effect of this refactoring on the performance? I agree that if the performance increase is negligible/insignificant, we'll probably be better off leaving those patterns alone.

I'm under the impression that these matchers would be repeatedly created especially with the frequency that these functions are called. Perhaps the compiler may have automatically optimised it for us.

This looks pretty neat! I'm thinking that for "changing group by", if we highlight a repo under a user, then switching the "group by" can highlight that user under the repo? This would probably require some searching and storing of repo and user information, but it would keep the consistency between the grouping orders.

Would it be possible to use another shade of green? In it's current state, certain parts of code are a bit difficult to read.

There are a few ways I can think of to resolve this:
1. Change the font color 
2. Change the highlight color
3. Make the highlight colors lighter

I'd suggest making the highlight colors lighter first because it's easier and less impactful, though I think the opposite problem may occur (partial credit is hard to distinguish from untouched lines).

Examples:

LGTM! I realised that the bug may be caused by my comment in the original PR suggesting to move the `full.push(res)` statement block out of the if-else statement (oops).

I think the `getFilteredRepos` method should probably be refactored sometime soon though, since there are some lines going up to 5(!) levels of indentation. In another PR maybe?

LGTM! Just one nitpick:
The "state" of the button doesn't persist across refreshes. The "breakdown by file type" and "merge all groups" checkboxes retain their state when refreshed, so I think it would be good for the new checkbox to follow this behaviour as well!

### What feature(s) would you like to see in RepoSense
&lt;!--
  Provide a clear and concise description of the feature.
-->
The author-config.csv file supports functionalities that make using RepoSense more powerful, but it requires some setup. It would be more user-friendly to support this functionality through the CLI --repo flag, especially since:
1. The CLI --repo flag already overrides the --config flag
2. The --repo flag syntax is a subset of the author-config repository syntax.

### If possible, describe the solution
Parsing the argument with the same parser as the author-config one with minor modifications is a good place to start. However, the need for additional information would mean that the alternative is more feasible.

Alternatively, we can use another flag for a lite version of the author-config file, like restricting it to one author. This can also lead towards encouraging using RepoSense as a portfolio tool.

Currently, the format for configuring the one-stop config file `repo-config.csv` is difficult for inexperienced users to use. Additionally, it is not friendly for those trying to create a code portfolio.

Repurpose `report-config.json` into a one-stop config file in a file format that is more user-friendly. Possible formats include `yml` and `xml`. Additionally, include more configuration options (to be decided).

This means that the order of priority would be this new file, then `repo-config`, then the rest of the `csv` files.

We can use the currently implemented [Hash Mode](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/essentials/history-mode#Hash-Mode) or [HTML5 Mode](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/essentials/history-mode#HTML5-Mode) of Vue Router to achieve this.

While the rules have been removed from `stylelint v15` onwards, they have recently been moved to a [community plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stylistic/stylelint-plugin). If we use this plugin, we can update `stylelint` to the latest version (barring other breaking changes).

Regarding the `pug` issue, given that we no longer have any `pug` extension files, perhaps this is not such a pressing issue. [This](https://github.com/rashfael/eslint-plugin-vue-pug) might be worth a look for the `pug` templates in the `Vue` files.

I tried working on this, but was unsuccessful. Here are some things I learnt:

- Updating Node to 18 requires [node-sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass) to be updated to at least 8.0
- However, node-sass has been [depreciated](https://sass-lang.com/blog/libsass-is-deprecated/) in favor of dart-sass (sass), which is already used in the project.
- Additionally, node-sass on windows has a few more [requirements](https://github.com/sass/node-sass#install) that make it harder to set up.
- Therefore, it would be easier to remove node-sass and use sass exclusively.
- Attempting to do so resulted in a bug similar to #1784 , but the cause is unclear.

I suggest we use [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) instead because `vue-cli` is being put on maintenance and its suggested replacement [`create-vue`](https://github.com/vuejs/create-vue) runs on Vite.

As discussed, this is not the [first time](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/pull/9166) Docker has been introduced to the NUS-OSS ecosystem. Given that RepoSense is an on-premise system, it makes much more sense to introduce Docker here compared to TEAMMATES. It's not as if the current Java jar system is overly troublesome, but it could reduce the odds of unexpected OS-specific or version-specific issues from popping up.

The bigger issue would be the learning curve to picking Docker up. As this is an open source project targeted towards student contributors, we would need to ensure the difficulty of running a Docker setup locally is as difficult as running the Java system currently. This can be achieved with a proper guide. Also, we should abstract the Docker details so that newcomers won't be confused.

Another issue would be continuity. This would add another key technology to maintain, so each batch of RepoSense developers would need a person with knowledge of Docker. From what we discussed, it seems the basic Docker script to generate the executable/image won't be too complex for newcomers, but we should be mindful regardless.

Apologies prof, it seems to be another bug that came from moving the Segment CSS into the Segment file.

The bug occurred when the CSS for the Segment file was set to scoped, which somehow interfered with the overriding of the hljs CSS with locally defined CSS.

I'll push a fix and tests ASAP.

Hey @weiquu, if im not wrong the other methods are just pure function calls from the db class which should be covered in the test cases from the db class. Should I be testing those as well?

Thanks for the feedback, I'm not quite sure whats an easy way to resolve this, but I changed it to split at the last comma instead of  the first, so this at least guarantees a length of 2, and also since it is more likely that the institute contains a comma, as compared to the country. Otherwise, do you have any suggestions on how to handle this?

Here's the current code for reference 
```
const lastCommaIndex = request.institute.lastIndexOf(', ');
const [institute, country] = lastCommaIndex === -1
        ? [request.institute, '']
        : [request.institute.slice(0, lastCommaIndex), request.institute.slice(lastCommaIndex + 2)];

Updated with the above-mentioned changes, so the institute and country variables are now combined as `instituteAndCountry` on the `AccountRequestTableRowModel`

i'll just edit this to be less misleading, because theres no simple way to verify if a particular document upload failed for an account request, unless its done 1 by 1

the number was mentioned on the Slack thread, not sure if its necessary but I guess a test run with a similar number of rows inserted could be set-up on the staging environment, to see if this poses any issues. In any case I think we should get more opinions on this as well

Update, i did testing on staging with a similar row count, time taken was about ~940 seconds for the entire flow, with the main bottleneck being the upload of documents

I think Hibernate automatically persists the changes, as per the [documentation](https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/4.0/devguide/en-US/html_single/#d0e1739).

This test in `UpdateStudentActionIT` should also verify that the changes are being persisted:
```
public void testExecute_typicalCase_success() throws Exception ``{``
...
        Student updatedStudent = logic.getStudent(student1.getId());
        assertEquals(updatedStudent.getEmail(), newStudentEmail);
        assertEquals(updatedStudent.getTeamName(), newStudentTeam);

I think the javadocs might be outdated? It seems `frDb.updateFeedbackResponse` in the datastore version of `updateFeedbackResponseCascade` does do the recreation, but the current sql version simply merges.

I chose to define the limits based on where the method is being called. In this case, since `seedFeedbackQuestions` is called by `seedCourseEntities` instead of `seedFeedbackSession`, I based the limit on course instead. 

We could change it to cascade from `seedFeedbackSession` instead if we think its clearer too?

Good catch, I think I mistakenly deleted the line when I was considering this [optimisation](https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/query-data/multiple-range-fields#order_fields_in_decreasing_order_of_query_constraint_selectivity). If my understanding is correct, should we filter by session name before courseId? The assumption here is that session name has higher selectivity than courseId.

I was thinking that we could deal with one issue at a time, instead of having to parse a giant wall of errors, since its probable that the initial issue causes many of the ensuing entities to fail. I feel that this approach might be more manageable for debugging, what do you think?

According to [the docs](https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/3.5/reference/en/html/performance.html), 
> Certain operations do not require proxy initialization:
> - equals(): if the persistent class does not override equals()
> - hashCode(): if the persistent class does not override hashCode()
> - The identifier getter method

Here, since we only call `getId()`, it should not perform a join query. By enabling Hibernate's sql logging, we are able to verify that no query is made between the two print statements for the following edit:
```
System.out.println("\n\nbefore");
boolean check = newSession.getCourse().getId().equals(oldSession.getCourseId());
System.out.println("after\n\n");
```

Actually, even after changing the call to `getInstitute` instead of `getId()`, Hibernate still doesn't query anything. I think this is probably because the course is already cached in the persistence context.

Without `courseRoot.fetch(...)`, we are unable to call `s.getName()` outside of the transaction as it will result in an error - `could not initialize proxy - no Session`.

I timed a few runs with various combinations, with the same 10k teams:

| | run 1 | run 2 | run 3|
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| query fetch (current) | 1m 17s | 1m 16s | 1m 17s |
| query fetch after line 71 | 1m 18s | 1m 17s | 1m 15s |
| query no fetch with map | 1m 20s | 1m 21s | 1m 19s |
| query fetch with map | 1m 11s | 1m 13s | 1m 12s |
| getRef with map | 1m 20s | 1m 21s | 1m 22s |
| get with map | 1m 19s | 1m 18s | 1m 18s |

Looks like moving the fetch to after line 71 might not have a large impact, but the most optimised setup is a query fetch with a `SectionNameToSectionMap`.

The performance of moving `commitTransaction` to the end with no other changes is similar to `query no fetch with map` above. 

From the sql logs, using fetch results in one select instead of two, which seems to provide performance benefits.
```
Hibernate: select ... from courses c1_0 left join sections s1_0 on c1_0.id=s1_0.course_id where c1_0.id=?
...
```
vs
```
Hibernate: select ... from courses c1_0 where c1_0.id=?
Hibernate: select ... from sections s1_0 where s1_0.course_id=?
...
```

Using `persist` instead of `saveEntityDefered` reduces migration time to ~47s. 

Using `stream().filter(...).findfirst()` instead of `sectionNameToSectionMap` to retrieve `Section` also seems to save a couple seconds, however this is with a small `MAX_SECTION_PER_COURSE` of 10, so I'll just leave the map in for now.

This might not work as expected, since the same "Account Google ID %s" is reused for students in every course. If we are seeding many courses, it is very probable that every "Account Google ID %s" will end up with an account. 

One possible way would be to use `if (i % n == 0)` instead, so that every `n`th student has an account. 

I believe that we should also set `studentGoogleId` to `null` above, and assign the proper string within this if-statement, since in the data migration script we have :
```
if (oldStudent.getGoogleId() != null) ``{``
    userGoogleIdToUserMap.put(oldStudent.getGoogleId(), newStudent);
``}``

</div>

%%[created at: 2024 Feb 24 12:28:37]%%

In some logic class methods, 
1. an entity is retrieved from the database, 
2. the entity's fields are updated with new values, before
3. the entity is passed into an `db.updateEntity()` method, which then performs the verification checks. 

For example:

https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/blob/b69776810e1db550075cc31115f8fd3c573673ae/src/main/java/teammates/sqllogic/core/FeedbackQuestionsLogic.java#L193-L211

https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/blob/b69776810e1db550075cc31115f8fd3c573673ae/src/main/java/teammates/sqllogic/core/FeedbackResponsesLogic.java#L205-L214

However, according to the [Hibernate documentation](https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/4.0/devguide/en-US/html_single/#d0e1739), changes made by the setters are automatically persisted into the database, even though the new values could be invalid and fail the verification checks. This results in the database entity being polluted with invalid data.

I've tested this locally on `NotificationsLogic.updateNotification`:
https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/blob/b69776810e1db550075cc31115f8fd3c573673ae/src/main/java/teammates/sqllogic/core/NotificationsLogic.java#L81-L90

```
    @Test
    public void testUpdateNotification_invalidParameters_originalUnchanged() throws Exception ``{``

        Notification notif = new Notification(
                Instant.parse("2011-01-01T00:00:00Z"),
                Instant.parse("2099-01-01T00:00:00Z"),
                NotificationStyle.DANGER,
                NotificationTargetUser.GENERAL,
                "A deprecation note",
                "<p>Deprecation happens in three minutes</p>");
        notificationsLogic.createNotification(notif);

        String invalidLongTitle = "1234567890".repeat(10);

        assertThrows(
                InvalidParametersException.class,
                () -&gt; notificationsLogic.updateNotification(
                        notif.getId(),
                        Instant.parse("2011-01-01T00:00:00Z"),
                        Instant.parse("2099-01-01T00:00:00Z"),
                        NotificationStyle.DANGER,
                        NotificationTargetUser.GENERAL,
                        invalidLongTitle,
                        "<p>Deprecation happens in three minutes</p>"
                )
        );

        Notification actual = notificationsLogic.getNotification(notif.getId());
        assert actual.getTitle().equals("A deprecation note") : actual.getTitle();
        // java.lang.AssertionError: 12345678901234567890...

    ``}``
```

The update fails, but the entity retrieved from the database afterwards is still updated with invalidLongTitle.

If combined, the generated `ApiConst` enum in `./api-const.ts` would be a heterogeneous enum. I was concerned that this might introduce ambiguity and potential for bugs, so I put the string and number constants into separate enums. However, if it is OK for `ApiConst` to contain both `string` and `number`, I can put the email regex together with `ApiConst`.

----

**Example 1 (bug)**: [notification-edit-form.component.ts line 25](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/blob/master/src/web/app/pages-admin/admin-notifications-page/notification-edit-form/notification-edit-form.component.ts#L25)

```ts
  NOTIFICATION_TITLE_MAX_LENGTH = ApiConst.NOTIFICATION_TITLE_MAX_LENGTH;
```

Leaving this line as is results in a compilation error as the type inferred for `NOTIFICATION_TITLE_MAX_LENGTH` is not specifically `number`:
<img width="1295" alt="screenshot of compile error" src="https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/assets/40383042/0c72f083-b0cb-4fc5-91cb-f92c3acf0ecd">

It can be fixed by explicitly specifying the type `number` when declaring the variable, or changing it to `readonly`:
```ts
  NOTIFICATION_TITLE_MAX_LENGTH: number = ApiConst.NOTIFICATION_TITLE_MAX_LENGTH;
// or
  readonly NOTIFICATION_TITLE_MAX_LENGTH: number = ApiConst.NOTIFICATION_TITLE_MAX_LENGTH;
```

This seems to be an outlier, as the other components that similarly declare the API constants do use `: number` and/or `readonly` and work as expected.

**Example 2 (working)**: [instructor-search-page.component.ts line 69](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/blob/master/src/web/app/pages-instructor/instructor-search-page/instructor-search-page.component.ts#L69). This code uses the constants directly (`ApiConst.XYZ`) and works properly as the type is inferred correctly.
```ts
          if (searchStudentsTable.length >= ApiConst.SEARCH_QUERY_SIZE_LIMIT) ``{``
```

My other concern with leaving it for the back-end to check (besides the extra requests to the server) is that the display of errors in the front-end would be less clear if there are validation issues for multiple fields. Since the server response is not tied to a particular form field, the error(s) can only be displayed all at once at the bottom of the form and not near the relevant field(s).

I will add a comment to highlight the existence of the separate regexes.

Would it be better to put the front-end regex in the back-end `FieldValidator` (alongside the existing back-end one) and convert it together with the other API constants instead? This would reduce the likelihood of someone changing one without noticing the other. However, it could be confusing as the front-end regex isn't actually used in any of the back-end code, and the two regexes are somewhat redundant.

Could the plural name `comments` be somewhat ambiguous? A singular form name might be clearer in indicating that it is a single String and not a collection. (same with the other `String comments` elsewhere in the code)

I agree that it is hard to find an alternative name that sounds right. (I was thinking something along the lines of `commentsText`, but that seems a bit clunky.)

There may be a bit of confusion as the words "comment"/"comments" is also used in the context of feedback response comments. In that context, the plural "comments" would almost always be referring to a collection.

However, seeing as that context is quite separate from this one, leaving the string's name as `comments` is probably OK too.

I'm wondering if it would be possible to get `Config.SUPPORT_EMAIL` from the backend to put here instead of hardcoding `teammates@...`, similar to other email code in the backend. However, in the (unlikely) case that the support email ends up being changed, the admin can still edit it manually, so I think it's OK to leave it as it is for now.

Inorder to log the student and session ids it would incur additional reads on the creation of every log in GCP.

One idea around this is we can update other APIs to pass student/session ids to the frontend so this API can get the ids from the params?

Since we have changed the logs to store the ids, I changed it to use [`getReference()`](https://thorben-janssen.com/jpa-getreference/#the-getreference-method). 

This should make it such that we incur 0 db reads for this part.

Edit:
Since the ids are not validated anywhere we probably need a way to catch the error thrown so other logs will still get created. Can't quite figure out how yet since the error cant seem to be caught by wrapping `fslDb.createFeedbackSessionLog()` in a try catch

Hmm thats a good point, I think your suggestion should work fine since there is no downside to having it be ordered and in the future if there is a need to retrieve ordered logs the method can be easily found

yea you are right an error is thrown as the 2 classes cannot be cast to each other

I have made the following changes:

- add a `databundletype` param to the action
- update `putDocuments` method in `AbstractBackDoor`to have the new param in the request
- create `putSqlDocuments` method in `AbstractBackDoor`

I have the param and types hard coded instead of being added into `Const` as this action is only used by `AbstractBackDoor`(?) so that clean up is easier after migration or should I add them into `Const`?

Yes it is possible and it will show `Failed to log feedback session view` to the user, would it be better to call the function right after the required info is assigned (eg line 264) instead?

Because we need to wait for `loadPersonName` and `loadFeedbackSession` to finish before we can log. The current solution attempts to log once at `loadPersonName` and once at `loadFeedbackSession`

To prevent logging twice, this method just checks that both have been loaded by checking arbitrary data before calling the log service. Because it waits for arbitrary data in a component it might not be very reusable

But once we switch to SQL fully, we can move the check to the log service since `feedbackSessionId` will no longer be allowed to be null

I tried and couldnt get forkJoin to work, maybe if there are any forkjoin experts or other more elegant methods we can try them

There is a endpoint for all pending requests, we can try to get all pending requests and then filter out this particular request by comparing all the attributes?

Should not be too bad for the purposes of the E2E test since there should not be many account requests in the db?

Edit: Cedric's point on the success message makes sense as well and is also probably more maintainable

I don't think calling HibernateUtil.remove(course) can cascade delete other entities, maybe need to do something like in [CourseLogic](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/blob/master/src/main/java/teammates/sqllogic/core/CoursesLogic.java#L119)

I enabled sql logging and realise this line doesn't trigger a join (or select from Course table in fact). I tested by adding `sqlEntity.getCourse().getName()` and it did trigger a select from Course table if we access fields other than the FK.

This is the verification phase anyway, i think the bottleneck is eager fetching deadline extentions and feedback questions during the query phase.

@NicolasCwy
Is it gonna be costly to query the sql db for every entity here?
Also do we need a `MarkIsMigrated` script for `Course` like the `MarkIsMigratedForAccounts.java` since Course has a `isMigrated` field? If needed then maybe can just check if `!isMigrated` ?

When I tested it one entity in the typical data bundle (which tests for sanitizing injection in the instruction field) has one more space character than the saved sql version, and the reason is that sanitization I believe is forced before instructions are saved (sql), and it will strip more stuff than what datastore does.

Feedback - this solution is one possible way to manipulate the visibility of the Card view component. Kudos to thinking in terms of hiding per card view component using css properties so that the filters will work. However it is better practice to hide the elements in the html file instead, and accessing the length and isLoading variables via the html file.

> Labels and issue names are likely always different across repos. Should I continue to work on storing search bar and labels?

Actually, for CS2103 projects which is the main use case for WATcher, they will most likely be same or similar. It's up to you if you want to continue working on it or create a separate issue for someone else to pick up. 


> If so should I ignore labels that don't exist on the new repo?

Yes, drop label selections that don't exist

> I just tried to directly edit the link. It seems like it will also redirect to the login page for a valid route. I think this might be because this action causes the website to reload, and the `isAuthenticated` state is lost. My idea is that we might want to use JWT for authentication, so every time the website reloads, it will check whether the stored JWT is valid instead of resetting the `isAuthenticated` state. What do you all think?

This digs into why CATcher doesn't have persistent login on reload. For security reasons, CATcher doesn't store a JWT on the browser/client-side because CATcher does not have a server-side db to verify the JWT.

@MadLamprey 
> 1. How is it intended to be accessed - as a button on the Issues Dashboard or some other way?

There was a drop down on the top left for changing from issue to activity, similar to how we change phases in CATcher when we have multiple phases available in development mode. 

> 2. As for the points mentioned in the issue, what has to be improved in the Date selector?

Ircc, current date selector uses two individual date pickers to filter, there is a date picker for a range, but this needs investigation if it is viable to be replaced with that.

Of course possible to make it more automated, we could make it more automated for Watcher since its not mission critical. So we can have a deploy branch that when pushed to runs the github actions automatically.

Is there a use case for hiding the UI label without excluding it from search? If there is, 
- How can we present this feature in a better way
- Would it be too much effort for the user to click through each label that they are not interested in just to hide a UI

Or,

Unlike Github, WATcher displays the issues in shorter width, so it is much easier to run out of horizontal space to display all the labels

> Three-state checkbox

Kind of goes against what users expect of a checkbox, but it is a possible solution

I would suggest together with that, also change the label colours or some bigger indicator on the label name itself so it is more obvious to the user if it is negated or selected. As the checkbox is quite small

Added the `afterEach` teardown hook, @yucheng11122017 do please take a look (and sorry for doing this after your review)

Edit: after looking at some code on StackOverflow regarding this, it seems that they put the `jest.clearAllMocks()` method in a `beforeEach` hook instead of an `afterEach` hook. I think this makes a bit more sense in the edge case that this test suite runs after another test suite which didn't reset the mocks after the other tests were run.

This bit was left unchanged because the logic for the `content` attribute is slightly different. According to the [docs](https://markbind.org/userGuide/components/popups.html#popovers), the `src`and `content` attributes and the `content` slot can be used for popovers. If all three are present then MarkBind will prioritise them in the following order:
1. `content` slot
2. `content` attribute
3. `src` attribute

So the logic to process this attribute (and especially the logger warning) is different than the other attributes. Specifically, it needs to check for the case that the `src` and `content` attributes are both used, and show a warning message if that is the case. The `processSlotAttribute` method does not account for this case, so this chunk of code is still here.

I'm not entirely happy with the name of the method but it's the best I can come up with. Some other alternatives I've considered are:
* `processSlottableAttribute`
* `processAttributeCanBeOverridden`
* `processOverridableAttribute`
* `processAttributeWithSlot`

Let me know your thoughts thanks.

The `check_docs` test is failing because the PR is doing its job - it's giving logger warnings when attributes for a quiz are being overridden:
![Screenshot 2024-04-10 at 4 21 56 PM](https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/assets/68138671/f6fd986f-7138-44d2-8e75-dbdb0cbe67d2)

The warnings arise from the panel in the Header and Hint example with **slots** at [this page](https://markbind.org/userGuide/components/others.html#questions-and-quizzes) (the relevant documentation file is `/docs/userGuide/syntax/questions.md`), where the code for the question in the panel is
```html
<question type="checkbox" header="Which of the following is true?" hint="Think out of the box! :fas-box:">
  &gt;!-- Header slot -->
  <div slot="header">
<p>Which of the following is correct?</p>
<p>Challenge: Try to get all the answers on your first try! ⭐️ ⭐️</p>
  </div>
&gt;!-- other code omitted for brevity -->
  &gt;!-- Hint slot -->
  <div slot="hint">
<p>Think out of the box! <span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-box"></span></p>
<p>Need another hint? <tooltip content="Two of the answers are correct!">Hover over me!</tooltip> <span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-mouse-pointer"></span></p>
  </div>
</question>
```

As can be seen, the `header` and `hint` attributes are overridden by their respective slots, which then triggers a logger warning. A simple fix would be to delete the `header` and `hint` attributes, so I'm wondering if it's OK to do this in this PR or if I need to create a separate PR for this.

I tested the rest of the other attributes for the components to see whether they're able to be overridden by slots.

Looks like the `header`, `content` and `label` attributes for `a-point` are able to be overridden by slots

Also, the `header` attribute for `tab` is also able to be overridden by a slot

As well as the `content` attribute for `tooltip`

And the `alt` attribute for `panel`
![Screenshot 2024-04-12 at 1 39 29 PM](https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/assets/68138671/623559a6-2899-4b18-825b-31878ffc360d)

Basically that's all the attributes that are handled by `MdAttributeRenderer.ts`. The PR is updated to use `processSlotAttributes` for the rest of the attributes.

Generally looks good, thanks for refactoring all the error messages into a single service. 

I think you're trying to implement the extra check for repo validity in `session-selection.component.ts` now, but that should be in a separate PR.

There's also a bunch of linting changes but it looks ok to me. Maybe you can put that in your PR and commit message as well.

Not sure why we need to use spread syntax here since `VALID_SESSION_DATA` only has one property `sessionRepo` and you seem to be overriding it. I think it's clearer just to do `of(``{`` sessionRepo: null ``}``)`. Similar comments for lines 30, 45 and 54.

This might be a good place to use spread syntax to override object properties but probably something like this

Actually this PR could have been broken down further into 2 PRs: one for the Login component and one for the Session model. In fact I'll probably encourage you to break down the second part of your test refactoring PR to 4 separate PRs: one for each spec you're refactoring - makes our job as reviewers easier (since we can review 1 spec at a time without having to review all 4) and also means that reviews will be faster.

hmm what i meant is that the constant name sort of implies that the constant value is `true`, but it's actually `false`. maybe something like `DEFAULT_DOES_NOT_HAVE_PRIVATE_REPO_PERMISSION` might work

Thanks for this PR! A quick test does show that the username doesn't display in the top right corner after logging in though, see the screenshot below.

Sorry didn't catch this earlier but this seems to be the implementation of the method? The expected result should be a new `Milestone` right? It doesn't really make sense to put logic in the expected test result.

And then you can create another test spec with a `GithubIssue` without a milestone to check if the milestone is `Milestone.DefaultMilestone`.

You should test this using an issue with assignees. Also, your expected value should be an array of the assignees' logins, rather than using a method to generate it.

Currently these tests only test for 4 or so properties of `Issue`? This is probably because the `GithubIssue` constants we're using haven't been adapted for WATcher.

I think we should rewrite the issues in `githubissue.constants.ts` first to match the schema of issues we have in WATcher, and then we refactor these tests.

Sorry after reviewing another of your PRs I went to take a closer look at this one and it seems that you're testing for implementation rather than the expected behaviour (even if the implementation gives the expected behaviour). Generally the expected values shouldn't have any logic or methods in them. 

Hope this makes sense, if it doesn't you can PM me.

I think we should test for the intended behaviour of the method instead of testing for its implementation. By writing this test spec, we're basically forcing `changeRepositoryIfValid` to call `changeCurrentRepository` - which doesn't sit quite right. So in this case, we should test for whether `this.currentRepo` is `WATCHER_REPO`, whether the correct logging message is logged and whether the repo url is stored in the cache service.

since we've defined the issue body limit as a constant and it's unlikely that we're going to pass in another limit, i think the `@Input` decorator here is unnecessary. in the future if we somehow decide that another comment field needs another input limit then we can add it back in.

Currently the line separators are added by the CATcher scripts to move the issues to the various repos as described in the user workflow page in the docs, and only Prof @damithc has access to those scripts. Hence, to make this change Prof would have to edit his scripts first. 

Also, there are line separators used in `issue-dispute-section-parser.model.ts` and `moderation-section-parser.model.ts`, so please change them to the new HTML tag for consistency (and update the relevant tests). Thanks!

There's a bug here: if you look at line 117 of `label.service.ts` below it is
```
duplicate: new Label(undefined, 'duplicate', COLOR_BLUE)
```
instead of 
```
duplicate: new Label('undefined', 'duplicate', COLOR_BLUE)
```
i.e. the category argument is `undefined` instead of `'undefined'`. This causes problems in `label.model.ts` where the the formatted name will turn out to be `undefined.duplicate` instead of just `duplicate`.

My suggestion is to rename the `Undefined` attribute to something like `NoCategory`, and edit `label.model.ts` accordingly.

Thanks for your PR! There are some changes that I've suggested you make.

I'm not sure whether you want to also refactor `label.model.ts`, `github-issue.model.ts` and `github-label.model.ts` (might have missed something out) to take advantage of your label enums. Personally I think it's ok to do so since CATcher is more or less complete so we don't anticipate any more issue attributes. Perhaps the other senior devs can weigh in on this.

Might be better to use `Number(cachedPageSize)` for greater clarity? And also to standardise with line 19. `Number` behaves in almost exactly the same way as  the unary `+`, and none of the page sizes are one of the funny corner cases anyway.

Looks good, tested it on my end too and it works. 

Some minor nitpicks about naming things - would be good to put the phase that the table belongs to in the table name to avoid confusion. E.g. `tableFaulty` could be something like `tableTeamResponseFaulty` to avoid confusion with `tableFaultyIssue` which apperas in the Tester Response phase.

Also the selector for the new directive `itemsPerPage` could also be renamed to avoid confusion with `pageSize`, because at first glance they sort of mean the same thing. Also, inputting a table name to something called `itemsPerPage` is not very intuitive.

Thanks for this! Can you see if it's possible to implement this as an [Angular Form Validator](https://angular.io/api/forms/Validators).

Also, the original issue was that CATcher couldn't load websites like `catcher-org.github.io/CATcher/phaseBugReporting/issues/13/abcde`.

Seems like this is duplicating the first part of the `updateIssue` method. What do you think about renaming this method as `updateGithubIssue` and then refactoring `updateIssue` to something like
```javascript
updateIssue(issue: Issue): Observable<Issue> ``{``
  return this.updateGithubIssue
    .pipe(
      map((response: GithubIssue) => ``{``
        response.comments = issue.githubComments;

``}``

The [Testing](https://catcher-org.github.io/dg/testing.html) page on the DG contains a section on loading custom sessions for CATcher, but does not detail how to create or set up these custom sessions. As such, new developers may be confused about how these custom sessions work.

There should be some documentation on how to set up these custom sessions. In addition, documentation on how to populate the custom repositories specified in the session with GitHub issues and comments would be helpful.

To test for logger input, the logger is mocked and then calls to the logger are checked (see #2463 for an example). However, this must be done every for every file that the logger is mocked in, which is a bit annoying.

### Describe the solution you'd like

Create a [manual mock](https://jestjs.io/docs/manual-mocks) of the logger, so that we can just call `jest.mock('logger');` at the start of each test. The default implementation of manual mocks can also be [overridden](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48790927/how-to-change-mock-implementation-on-a-per-single-test-basis) though it's a bit more finnicky to do so.

> Cool suggestion, I think this makes sense if the setup code for the logger is long. Just wondering which functions you want to mock with the logger? If the mock is just warn, info, error for example, there might be an argument made for mocking them at the start of each test case instead so that the tests are totally independent and not based on outside "logic"

Actually after thinking and reading about this a bit more I realise there isn't much need to do a manual mock for the logger since as discussed in #2099 it makes more sense to test for logger calls than logger outputs. So the automatic mock of `jest.mock('/path/to/logger');` would work just fine since it replaces all the methods with another method that just returns `undefined`. 

I think I'll close this issue then.

### What is the area that this feature belongs to?

Testing

### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

There are two issues that arise from #2463 (and I'll be quoting myself):

_Inconsistent naming in `NodeProcessor.data.ts`_

The naming conventions of the test inputs in `NodeProcessor.data.ts` are inconsistent. Many of the elements there have a test to check if the slots do override the attributes of the elements, but they are named in two separate ways:
1. `PROCESS_[ELEMENT]_ATTRIBUTES_NO_OVERRIDE`
2. `PROCESS_[ELEMENT]_[ATTRIBUTE]_SLOT_TAKES_PRIORITY`

I think that's why the author of #2053 wrote another constant called `PROCESS_PANEL_HEADER_SLOT_TAKES_PRIORITY` when the constant `PROCESS_PANEL_ATTRIBUTES_NO_OVERRIDE` tests for the exact same thing. That's why I have an `expect` statement after each of these two tests, because in both times the logger is called with the same input. 

_Logger warnings still inconsistent_

With the merging of #2053, Panels, Dropdowns, Modals and Popovers print warnings to the console if there are slots overriding the element attributes. However, other elements such as Quizzes and QOptions do not print warnings when this happens. This is because in the code of `MdAttributeRenderer.ts`, not every attribute is checked to see if there is an overriding slot, so the logger will not warn if the unchecked attributes are overridden. 

### Describe the solution you'd like

Firstly, standardise the constant names in `NodeProcessor.data.ts` to `PROCESS_[ELEMENT]_[ATTRIBUTE]_SLOT_TAKES_PRIORITY` as it is clearer than the other alternative. 

To fix the inconsistent logger warnings once and for all, implement this new method
```javascript
processAttribute(node, attribute, isInline, slotName = attribute) ``{``
    if (!this.hasSlotOverridingAttribute(node, attribute, slotName) ``{``
        this.processAttributeWithoutOverride(node, attribute, isInline, slotName);
    ``}``
``}``
```
and use it for every attribute of the node. 

Lastly, create unit tests so for every attribute that can potentially be overriden. 

This issue will require at least 3 PRs, namely:

- [x] #2483
- [x] #2511 
- [ ] #2525
- [ ] #2526

### Please confirm that you have searched existing issues in the repo

Yes, I have searched the existing issues

### Any related issues?

#2511

### Tell us about your environment

macOS Ventura 13.6.3

### MarkBind version

5.4.0

### Describe the bug and the steps to reproduce it

Switch to the #2511 PR, go to the `docs` directory, run `markbind serve -d`. Logger warnings should appear

### Expected behavior

This is the expected behaviour, but apparently logger warnings cause the `check-docs` GitHub Action to fail, as in the screenshot below
![Screenshot 2024-04-10 at 4 21 56 PM](https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/assets/68138671/5df64e3c-f356-460e-b0d7-647c43ca7e68)

Thus, for the GitHub action to pass, there should not be any logger warnings, so there should not be any overridden attributes.

### Anything else?

The logger warnings are caused by this block of code in `/doc/userGuide/syntax/questions.md`
```html
<question type="checkbox" header="Which of the following is true?" hint="Think out of the box! :fas-box:">
  &gt;!-- Header slot -->
  <div slot="header">
<p>Which of the following is correct?</p>
<p>Challenge: Try to get all the answers on your first try! ⭐️ ⭐️</p>
  </div>
&gt;!-- other code omitted for brevity -->
  &gt;!-- Hint slot -->
  <div slot="hint">
<p>Think out of the box! <span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-box"></span></p>
<p>Need another hint? <tooltip content="Two of the answers are correct!">Hover over me!</tooltip> <span aria-hidden="true" class="fas fa-mouse-pointer"></span></p>
  </div>
</question>
```
The `header` and `hint` attributes are being overridden by the slots. The fix is simple, just replace the top line with
```html
<question type="checkbox">
```

### Describe the bug and the steps to reproduce it

In [this part](https://markbind.org/userGuide/components/presentation.html#tabs) of User Guide, there is a code snippet that shows how to specify a header for a Tab-group. However, the header is not there, as seen in the screenshot below.

### Expected behavior

The tab group should have a header called "Third tab group 🌌 " for the first tab group and "Disabled fourth tab group" for the second tab group

### Anything else?

I reverted the codebase to v3.0.0 to test it myself and it still doesn't work in that version :( So I don't think it's caused by the Bootstrap migration from v4 to v5.

> @Eclipse-Dominator Great! How can I recreate this instance so that I can work on it? I have just setup the dev environment and am on the main screen.

Hello, the default repo in the dev environment (I'm assuming you ran `npm run ng:serve:web`) can only be accessed by devson the CATcher team so unfortunately you can't use that. Please refer to the section on Setting up custom CATcher sessions in the [testing page of the docs](https://catcher-org.github.io/dg/testing.html) to be able to view issues in CATcher. The relevant component in this issue can be see in the Bug Reporting phase so don't worry about not being able to access the other phases. 

If you've taken CS2103T then you can save a bit of time and skip populating a repo with dummy issues by using one of the repos used when you tested CATcher in CS2013T (e.g. alpha). To do that, just configure the `settings.json` file as follows:
```
``{``
  "openPhases" : ["phaseBugReporting", "phaseTeamResponse", "phaseTesterResponse", "phaseModeration"],
  "phaseBugReporting": "alpha",
  "phaseTeamResponse": "pe-results",
  "phaseTesterResponse": "alpha",
  "phaseModeration": "pe-evaluation"
``}``
```

Hope this helps!

After having a bit of a think, I'm not sure whether we should be testing the console output itself, or what the Winston logger is called with. Testing the console output itself seems like we're also testing the Winston logger, which seems out of the scope of a unit test. Instead, I think we should just test that the Winston logger has been called with the appropriate logging level and message. So something like
```
import * as logger from '/packages/core/src/utils/logger'

// mock the warn function of the logger here

expect(logger.warn).toHaveBeenCalledWith(args...);
```

What do you think about it?

Since `shouldEmit` is true by default, and all methods which are calling `createAndSaveIssueModels` (`initializeData` and `getLatestIssue`) do not pass the `shouldEmit` parameter, it seems that we do not need the `shouldEmit` parameter in the first place. Besides, if there are any updates to the state, changes should be made known to the rest of the application; so let's look at removing the shouldEmit parameter for now until we find a use case for needing to selectively emit issues which are updated.

Upon testing, I realised that changing repositories actually leads to having to authenticate again (as you mentioned in your comment). I think it might be good to persist session to sessionStorage in order for better UI/UX. However, I think this works pretty well by itself in the mean time, so let's add it as a separate issue and work on it after this is merged.

Unusual to have both side effects (caching) and navigation although definitely wrong! Perhaps it might be better to add some comments or documentation to why this was done (as it took some time for me to understand the logic here behind intercepting the repo location and then rerouting to `issuesViewer`)

If there isn't anything changed here, let's move this back to the previous structure of 
```suggestion
    this.authService.setRepo()
      .subscribe(

`sessionStorage.getItem` returns null anyway if item does not exist, so it isn't necessary to add the null set here. To be precise, we can instead add the type to be either string or null since it isn't very explicit acccording to the sessionStorage API

This has a very similar name to `RepoUrlCacheService`, maybe we could rename it to `RepoSessionStorageService`? This allows for lesser confusion esp within the SessionSelectionComponent and is a more direct approach, indicating it's about storing a repo within session storage.

From this, we only set up a session if `cacheRepoFromUrlService.repoLocation != null`

But setupSession does not use `cacheRepoFromUrlService`, and it will never set up the session if we are using the url encoded repo.

Seems like there's duplication of the logic when updating dropdownFilter itself. For instance, `updateSelectedLabels` is in essence doing the same thing as `updateHiddenLabels` and even the other methods: to update the right property. Instead, maybe we could follow a pattern of composition using the `Partial<T>` API in TypeScript?

This could look something like this:

```ts
updateFilters(newFilters: Partial<DropdownFilter>): void ``{``
  this.dropdownFilter$.next(
    ...this.dropdownFilter$.value,
    ...newFilters,
  ),
``}``
```

Then after we update, we can check our rules for updating the status and type. 

Consumers would then simply pass some filters that they want to change in the components themselves.

Makes sense to apply filter then sort the data, but `applyDropdownFilter` only has one consumer in `IssuesDataTable::loadIssues` and `getSortedData` only has one consumer in `applyDropdownFilter`. Can we ensure single responsibility by just having `applyDropdownFilter` apply the filters, and after the filters have been applied, apply the sort directly in `IssuesDataTable::loadIssues`?

Resetting a user to undefined feels weird, although as per the specifications given in User Service, aligns with implementation. Might be worth to change this in a separate issue, to something like null. Null has a meaning which aligns much more closely with what we are trying to achieve here.

**Describe the bug**
Currently, the documentation within the developer guide does not accurately reflect the steps required to create and publish a release. 

<img width="998" alt="image" src="https://github.com/CATcher-org/CATcher/assets/68676914/359a8477-94dc-4f1c-8b5d-9d6ec4f02a2d">

At the moment, the steps do not include updating the release branch to the main branch, and also does not clearly state that the `Version Deployment` action should be launched on the release branch.

We should include these steps to give more clarity to future developers when curating releases.

Given that node 14 (and 16 for that matter) have been [deprecated](https://endoflife.date/nodejs), perhaps it might be a good time to start upgrading to a version >16 and resolve dependency issues for packages. WDYT? @CATcher-org/developers 

For now, however, as mentioned by @seetohjinwei you can use [NVM](https://medium.com/devops-techable/how-to-install-nvm-node-version-manager-on-macos-with-homebrew-1bc10626181) to switch between versions of node.

Finally got the CI working. This comment will detail the changes made to the environment for the Angular 13 upgrade:

- Upgrade to `Node 16, npm8` from `Node14, npm6`
- `@octokit/core` isn't used directly as a dependency in our project, but `@octokit/rest` depends on it and `npm8` installs the latest one (`v6.1.2`), which doesnt support Node 16.
   - As such, this PR includes a new ~~dev dependency~~ dependency to freeze `@octokit/core` at v4, which is the last version to support Node 16
   - We should consider removing it once we upgrade to Angular 15, which supports Node 18.
 
- Manually install firefox for the `macos-latest` runner. As of this comment, `macos-latest` uses a macos 14 arm64 image, which doesnt include firefox. This seems to be a very recent change, since `macos-latest` always pointed to a x64 image which came pre-installed with firefox.

Thanks for the review @chunweii 

1. Ok, will move `octokit/core` to dependencies
2. Any reason for targeting `octokit/rest@18.12.0`? I am unable to find anything in the `octokit/rest` release notes about changing how `octokit/core` is depended upon. 
   - Either way and as you mentioned, the task of upgrading `octokit/rest` has alot of breaking changes. Going from v16 -&gt; v17 alone seems to introduce quite a bit of [breaking changes](https://github.com/octokit/rest.js/releases/tag/v17.0.0). As such, I think this is better off as a separate PR since it is not related to Angular 13.

after spending a few hours investigating this, I thought it might be interesting to share what caused this `ExpressionChanged...Error`.

Angular throws an `ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError` when an expression value has been changed after change detection has completed. (see: https://angular.io/errors/NG0100)

To begin you must first understand the stages in the component lifecycle (which includes change detection) - https://angular.io/guide/lifecycle-hooks#prerequisites

In this case, this is probably caused by a child component changing a parent's property. The parent would be `LabelFilterBarComponent`, the child would be `MatSelectionList`. The change detection is initiated by `this.selectedLabelNames = []`. The child then changes this property again through the two-way binding of `ngModel`:

```
<mat-selection-list [(ngModel)]="selectedLabelNames (selectionChange)="selectedLabels.next(selectedLabelNames)">
```

Didn't really understand how `ChangeDetectionRef` works so I experimented a little bit.

 `ChangeDetectorRef` appears to suppress this warning but it seems like there are still unintended effects.

For example. after selecting 4 elements, clicking the remove all button clears the selection, but it still says 3 selected. (see video)

Thanks for the investigation.

> 1. Is the repo empty or does it already have some images?
> 2. If it already has some images, what is the default branch of the repo?

When I tested it, the default branch was `master` with some commits. The `main` branch does not exist.

------------------------------------------

1. Specifying branch for empty repos

So for the initial commit, is it possible to specify the initial branch name to be whatever we want? 

------------------------------------------

2. Check for branch existence and create branch before uploading the image.

> I believe this solution is not ideal as it adds more API calls. 

I agree. Perhaps we can use an optimistic processing approach instead? In other words, upload the image and then take corrective action if the upload fails due to missing branch

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

I think it is fine to assume that users start out with an empty repository.

I tried creating a commit to a empty repo using the `createOrUpdateFile` API, and specifying the branch name as `x`. In the empty repo, the branch `x` is made, so it seems like there is no need to upload a dummy file for an empty repo with the branch we want. I think your PR as it is now should achieve this?

> - Branch out from latest commit for non-empty repo that does not have branch `main`.

We should do this when we optimistically upload the image file to `main`. 

> -Do nothing for non-empty repo that has branch `main`.

Right, because the branch we are uploading to exists, so there's nothing to do.

i don't see the benefit for observables too. I think an observable implementation is beneficial if we have more than 1 table listening to the same set of settings but so far we are saving the settings for each table (or to be more precise `table_name`, but currently each table has a unique `table_name`).

For some unknown reason, the `arrow-body-style` keeps failing CI at 2 specific lines even though it passes linting locally.

One of the instances is below, in `issue.service.ts`. The first function body passes the lint check on github CI, but the one on the bottom doesn't, even though they are exactly the same.

i feel not all the lint changes are for the best. for example the changes in `app-routing.module.ts` makes it harder to read. 

Also another personal preference would be to not change code en masse for the sake of styling as it makes it harder to trace code changes.

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
The codebase for CATcher's parser is not very well documented. 

This refers to the models and section parsers found under `src\app\core\models\templates`. For example, when looking through `tester-response-section-parser.model.ts`, it is not immediately obvious what some of the functions such as `buildExtractResponseParser(category: string)`, `buildTesterResponseParser` does.

Furthermore, the `TesterResponseSectionParser`, `DuplicateSectionParser`, etc all give a somewhat vague idea of what it is expected to parse, but there is no concrete example of the section it is parsing. 

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Documentation for some of the above parsers and helper methods under `src\app\core\models\templates`.

</div>

%%[created at: 2024 Feb 19 15:56:49]%%

`wait-on` is a cross-platform CLI utility to wait for files to be available.

There are 2 ways to use this library:
1. directly in the CLI
     - The command `wait-on` doesn't appear to be used at all in this project. 
     - The command `wait-on` is not used in `package.json` scripts
     - None of the packages use `wait-on` as a dev-dep (verified using `npm ls wait-on`)

2. Via the node.js programmatic API
     - a check using `npm-check` suggests that this is not used anywhere in code
     - `wait-on` is not imported anywhere based on a ctrl-f search on the repository
   
See: https://www.npmjs.com/package/wait-on#usage


From git blame, it appears that this library was included when this project was initialized in #1 and when electron was used.

**Describe the solution you'd like**

Use ESLint / whatever the state-of-the-art is instead of TSLint. 
As part of the migration, you should 
- evaluate our current lint rules and configuration and see if any of the newer features of ESLint/TSLint suit our use case
- identify all workflows/processes dependent on `TSLint`
- eventual migration of all workflows to ESLint
- figure out what is the latest version of ESlint available for us given that we are still quite behind on Angular and Node versions and determine how to best handle the subsequent package updates

I think the original intention of that icon is to hide labels on items that are cluttered with labels, to allow for easy viewing.

For example, an item like this has 4 labels, and users might want to hide some of them from view.

i got a warning instead of an error, but this difference in installation behavior is probably due to different npm versions.

[npm7 onwards appears to auto-install peer dependencies, causing the error. 
](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66239691/what-does-npm-install-legacy-peer-deps-do-exactly-when-is-it-recommended-wh)
You can probably use the `--legacy-peer-deps` to not auto-install peer dependencies and get the same warning as me... 

or we might need to upgrade ngx-markdown to v10.1.1, [which supports angular v10](https://github.com/jfcere/ngx-markdown/releases/tag/v10.0.0) to remove this peer-dependency error/warning

@joyngjr this issue is probably unrelated to npm/node, but some specific graphql library. It could have been corrupted/not installed properly when `npm install` was repeatedly executed

have you tried deleting the `package-lock.json` file and `node_modules` folder and running `npm install` again? Or perhaps a clean install. If the issue persists, send the log so we can help you better.

Also, if you are using Node 14 and npm v6, there shouldn't be a need for `--legacy-peer-deps`.

Just `npm install` will do.

This feature is to add the text next to the icon though - it doesn't replace the icon. 
I was thinking that it would be better if users can use both concurrently which is why there is the icon and then the text on the right.

> @yucheng11122017 I realised the first t-size and i-size one will affect the next ones on the same level is sort of intended. The styling is just carried down the levels. I think the documentation mentioned `If you customize any item on a certain level, you must also customize the first item on that level. If not, the list will revert to its uncustomized form.`

Yup I think this effect was intended by the original feature - which is why this is kept here.

Hi @kaixin-hc and @EltonGohJH, thank you for the comments! 
Realised that I did not push the documentation changes that I made... 😢 

One thing that I realised is that if the user disables both the text and the icon, there will basically be no bullet point. 
Do you think that this should be intended behaviour or should it revert back to the originally uncustomed bullet point?

Yeah I agree. But I guess this is a very specific scenario where the user disables both for some reason. And they could easily just... NOT do that. 
The empty string is more to disable the text or the icon in the event where a user only wants an icon or only wants the text. So I think that this seems to be more of a user issue.

True. With the #2375, users would be able to adjust the space manually if needed.

There is a simpler way to do this according to [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/40326507) which is just to check if you can edit a file on the repo. I was a bit reluctant to write this here because I'm not sure how legitimate this way is. 
But this does seem a lot easier to just do a quick check like this, rather than have to do a curl.

And I was concerned that the curl command/link would change due to API changes. 

TBH I'm kind of leaning towards using the 'just check if you can edit a file way' because its a lot easier, rather than having to like do a curl, get git hub token and so on.

What do you all think!

> I suppose your point on making a release might suffice (not sure)? if so it's a easy way to verify by checking whether the maintainer can make release -&gt; probably have the same rights to push to master

Hm I think you are right @tlylt according to this [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository)

I'll just remove this check that since if you can do a release - you should be able to push to master.

Been trying to add unit tests for annotation but having problems with stubbing `v-popover`. 
When I try to stub it, it simply creates an empty tag, hence all the annotation points are missing. 
Would appreciate any advice on this :)

Hi Hannah thanks a lot for checking through! Oddly, I also got the same issue when I ran it the first time again today, but afterwards the slots seemed to be working. The deploy preview is also accurately reflects the changes. Not too sure what is causing this issue but could you try running it again?

I believe you can add the max-height under modal-content by defining it in the style tag in the vue component as so:

```
<style>
.modal-content ``{``
   max-height: 100vh
``}``
...
</style

Thanks for the work @Tim-Siu! 
Could you also update the css file for the docs and the templates as well? Otherwise, it is not reflected in these files. 
Also, I'm looking at the code block right now and it doesn't look very nice. 
What I actually meant with my comment was to change it a darker color like #000000. 
Could we change it to use #000000 instead?

I'll prefer to make 127.0.0.1 as the default address if the host is invalid. Because 0.0.0.0 has some special meaning and might accidentally expose it to the rest of the interner (see [link](https://superuser.com/questions/949428/whats-the-difference-between-127-0-0-1-and-0-0-0-0)).

> > @yucheng11122017 @itsyme I researched on the difference between the null coalescing operator `??` and the OR operator `||` and found out that the main difference between them is during the handling of falsy values like 0, empty string, empty list etc. eg. ` 0 ?? 100` will return `0` but `0 || 100` will return `100`.
> > I was thinking if we should use the `??` operator while handling missing host and port (line 161-162) so that if the user specifically enter `0`, markbind will not default it to a specific host/port defined by us. eg. using `0 || 127.0.0.1` will set the host to be 127.0.0.1 but `0 ?? 127.0.0.1` will set the host to be 0.0.0.0 I feel like the latter is more suitable. What do you think?
> 
> I agree! My opinion is that we should use the nullish coalescing operator `??` in this case as this line should only be handling the responsibility of checking if any input is present from the user. For the other cases (e.g. 0, empty string, etc.), the responsibility should lie with the validation function instead. Wdyt @yucheng11122017 ?

Sounds good! Thanks for the research. Remember to write it in your knowledge base to get some credit HAHA

Hi @LamJiuFong thanks for the work! 
One thing is I think it might be better to keep 127.0.0.1 as the default if the customised port isn't valid. What do you think?

> I am thinking whether this template is minimal enough to be used in a general case? 

Hmmm imo, the user guide and home seems ok and minimal enough. I have some doubts about the developer guide though - in particular the design subsection which seems a bit too specific. I like the parts that show off markbind's functionality like puml diagrams and so on but the rest can be deleted i think. The two appendixes can be removed as well I believe. 
The three tutorials also seem too specific to AB3



> Important consideration is that we hope that CS2103 students can adapt this template for their use case too. (Removing too much may hinder them in using this template?)

tbh I think its ok for them to use this template since there is already an existing one made by yongliang which they can clone and work on more easily.

Hi @Tim-Siu if im understanding this correctly, the idea is that line numbers will naturally show if there is line wrapping already? Because if there is wrapping, a new line will be present but the numbers doesn't increase. Please correct me if i'm understanding your question wrongly! :)

OK sure sounds good! I was more concerned abt the global effect of script and css that was discussed here that made it sound like a breaking change but yeah I think bug fix sounds more appropriate.

This seems to be having unexpected effects - the styling doesn't apply to the tooltip anymore. 
You can try modifying the font size to something huge and then removing the one of the dashes, you realise the font change doesn't apply. 
Can we keep the old version? Will it automatically change every time the linter is run?

I think one thing we will have to be careful about is from now on that currently this script relies on 
`**Proposed commit message: (wrap lines at 72 characters)**`
and `**Checklist:** :ballot_box_with_check:` within the PR template to get the commit message. 
If we change the PR template, or if accidentally edits the PR template when making a PR, this check will fail. 
So if we change the PR template, we will have to update this script accordingly


This PR can definitely be expanded in the future for example, 
- checking if the commit message is wrapped at 72 characters
- checking for other empty fields 
- checking if checkboxes are ticked

Thanks for the work @yiwen101! 
This is a rather tricky bug to fix so appreciate the work. 

I have some concerns about the ordering of the footnote. I understand you aren't trying to address the wrong ordering here but I think this might result in overlaps - not just an issue with wrong ordering. Could you explain why you change the footnote number and why the appended footnote item will has the number 1-1? 

Thanks!

Hi @Tim-Siu, can I check how to use this feature? I have added `dataTable` to the plugins and then used 
```
<m-table sortable searchable>
| Name | Age | Country |
|------|-----|---------|
| John | 28  | USA     |
| Emily| 32  | Canada  |
| Michael | 41 | UK    |
| Sophia | 25 | Germany|
| David | 37  | Australia |
</m-table>
```

But it doesn't seem to work.

> Upon suggestions from @yucheng11122017 , I discovered that the inclusion of the m-table inside panel works if we specified `preload`.

Yes this seems to be the issue. Because the HTML isn't rendered until the user opens it, the plugin can't process it. This should likely be the same issue with Mermaid (@yiwen101 and @LamJiuFong) and with the full site search as well as @jingting1412 and I were discussing. 

@damithc said that he is okay with having this compromise - ie to integrate these features (full site search, tables and mermaids) but require panels to be preloaded by the user. This can be a workaround for now but we might need to think of a better way...

@Tim-Siu this shouldn't be true. You aren't making changes to these font and emoji files and hence there shouldn't be a change.

> I think this has to do with how I am adding the functional test. From my observation of the existing convention in MarkBind, plugin related functional tests are placed in a standalone directory like `test_site_algoloa_plugin`. The font files and emoji files are indeed present in that directory. You may find them under paths like packages/cli/test/functional/test_site_algoloa_plugin/expected/markbind/css/fonts/KaTeX_AMS-Regular.ttf

Ah ok I see my bad. I realised that you created a new test site - not added on to the original test site.

Hi @Tim-Siu thanks for the work on this! 

Before you continue, I think one is that this will always sort by text.. which is not necessarily what is needed. For example, the example that you gave perhaps you want to sort by numbers instead? But currently, if you add 28 vs 201, 201 will come before 28. 

Also, could you make sure that this will work for [external imports](https://markbind.org/userGuide/reusingContents.html#importing-variables-from-other-external-file-formats) as well? I think it doesn't work for now.

Ah I see. I think it could be better with the file where it came from so users know exactly where the error is. 
Apart from that, it seems ok to me.

Also another thing discussed by @kaixin-hc and I is the behaviour when the width and height is relative eg. 50% or max-width. 

Could you check @LamJiuFong and see if lazy loading will cause issues in that case?

Ah I see I must have missed this. In that case, I think its ok to continue with this current implementation. We can discuss seperately if we should allow the overriding of aspect ratio in that case. Checking in with @kaixin-hc if you have other opinions?

Ok great!

> Also, our current implementation of `Annotate` and `Pic` doesn't support the case where inputs are proportions eg. `width: 50%`. I think it is a good idea to support it but I am not sure if it should be tackled altogether in this issue because it looks like a separate feature?

Oh hmm I see. I was not aware of this. Thank you for investigating! We can discuss this seperately as well but you can ignore it for now. Thanks!

Hi @LamJiuFong thanks for the work on this PR! 

Personally, I'd prefer not to override the height to maintain the aspect ratio - this would be breaking behaviour in that case. Plus if users want to change the aspect ratio that is their choice as well. 
In other words, I think the expected behavior should be: if users enter both height and width, that should be used. Only if either one is missing, do we maintain the height ratio. 
wdyt? tagging @kaixin-hc  as well

Hi @KevinEyo1, one clarification: this i-one-off attribute is for all attributes right? Not just the icon. So if i-one-off is true, the other attributes are not saved as well?

Hi @KevinEyo1 thanks for the work. 

Some initial comments. 
I think the big thing is with the oneOff. I don't think it should be inherited in this case. Also please do check the boolean logic.

Hi @KevinEyo1 thanks for the work! I think the main issue I see now is the one off behaviour for the other attributes. This is something that you will need to deal with especially after #2444 gets merged. 
Also small nit: could you standardize the spelling of one-off?

Hi @luminousleek thank you very much! This looks like excellent and detailed work. 

- With regards to mocking vs spying, I think your reasons make sense 
- With regards, to naming conventions, yeah let's open an issue for this and tackle it in the future. 
- Lastly, with regards to the warnings, I'm actually not too sure why for some we don't have this warning and why for some we do. If one of the other developers can advice, that would be great. But if not, I think what you suggested (implementing warnings for all) would be the best way going forward.

Hi @KevinEyo1 thanks for the work! I think the biggest problem is the fact that is_``{``impact``}`` is 0 when the impact is chosen - this makes the rest of the code unintuitive since usually 1 is used for true.

Yeah I agree with @EltonGohJH. 
Plus the original discussion disagrees with the implementation detail of prepending the file to each of the files and I do think it is a bit hacky to do it this way.

Spoke to Kevin about this previously and he did this check: [Test run to check time](https://github.com/KevinEyo1/markbind/actions/runs/8565425538/job/23473461471?pr=38) which wasn't very long. So I don't think there is a need to overoptimize in this case.

Modern browsers have robust inbuilt mechanisms to auto-correct common causes of hydration. Therefore, to avoid high false positive rate, Markbind has a minimalist rule-based validation against violations. The code for this is located in `core/src/utils/htmlValidationUtils.ts`. 

Please help extend it when violations that cause hydration on browsers are spotted.

However as commented [here](https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/issues/2025), it turns out that modern browsers are quite robust and can tolerate most of the common html violations (eg: nesting block level in inline level, missing closing tag, missing quotation for href...) . So `causeHydration` tag is designed to differentiate `harmless` violations and violations that leads to hydration.

Hi @yiwen101 thanks for this PR! It seems very interesting and will definitely be useful for our users. 

One thing I wanted to ask is if the RuleBuilder is necessary? Could you initialise the Rule directly using a constructor? 

Could you also add some test cases to test `htmlValidationUtil.ts` functionality? Like show that there is a warning/error when a table is missing a body and so on. 

Another thing with regards to code quality is maybe we can abstract out the actual rules (like table needed a tbody) to a seperate file from `htmlValidationUtil.ts`. Then `htmlValidationUtil.ts` will load in these rules. So `htmlValidationUtil.ts` only handles creating rules while this other file will handle the actual rule content.

Is the difference between `.morph-display-wrapper-seamless` and `.morph-display-wrapper` only the inheritance of color? 
In that case, could we make it such that `.morph-display-wrapper-seamless` is just `color: inherit`? So that if we decide to change like the margin-top or something, we only change it in one place
So the button will always have the class `.morph-display-wrapper` and will have the class `.morph-display-wrapper-seamless`  if it is seamless

Hi @Tim-Siu, is this the desired behaviour? 
My impression from reading the issue and the comments is that there is a need for a warning message if the include content is empty, regardless of whether the fragment is optional or not. 

In other words, 
```
<includes src="path#empty" />
<div id="empty" />
```
will log a warning regardless of whether the include is optional or not.

Hi @Tim-Siu, I believe that the purpose of #2181 is to log when a user includes on a fragment that is empty. 

You can take a look at the [test case](https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/pull/2180/files#diff-ede52d35aee85f528271c5f36627945c37608764f10ac0dc45aa9edad2a9b04b) added by the original PR which lead to this issue. The idea is that if there a empty fragment like <div id="empty />, there should be a log that tells the user they are including an empty fragment. 

Eg. 
In trial.md
```
<includes src="trialInclude.md#empty" />
```

In trialInclude.md
```
<div id="empty" />
```
Because the div is empty, we add a log statement for the user. 

Right now, you are logging only if the fragment does not exist and optional is enabled. Eg. 

In trial.md
```
<include src="trialInclude.md#missing" optional />
```
In trialInclude.md there is no tag with missing id. 

We don't need this behaviour when optional is enabled because the whole idea is that if optional is enabled, the fragment can be skipped. Otherwise, the user shouldn't have enabled optional in the first place. 

Please let me know if you don't understand - Will be happy to explain again

Could you also fix the fact that the `#example` in site navigation menu being empty so that the build doc doesn't fail? 

It can be similiar to the one for page nav
```
<div id="examples" class="d-none">

You can see an example of a Page Navigation Bar ==on the right side== of <a target="_blank" href="``{`` baseUrl ``}``/userGuide/formattingContents.html">this page</a>.

Hi @Tim-Siu thanks for the work! 

One clarification: is the intention also to add a logging statement if the included file is empty? 

Eg. 
In trial.md
```
<includes src="trialInclude.md" />
```

while trialInclude.md is present but the file is empty. 

This behaviour doesn't trigger a warning right now.

Hi @jingting1412 thanks for the work! 

I think this issue about using baseUrl isn't just applicable to includes. It also affects panels, modals etc which use links. 

Could you update those areas also? Gentle reminder to use includes to avoid duplication.

Would be also good to add it to troubleshooting section in our user guide

Hmmm I think I wouldn't mind using the hash instead of the version number. 
If we need to update, we have to change the number anyway. The only extra steps involved is we have to go to the repository (which we should be doing anyway when doing an update) and obtain the new SHA. 
I think the benefit of better security is higher than the cost, especially with more dev ops that we are adding in thanks to @KevinEyo1.

I realized that our documentation might not be fully up to date - other attributes seem to work with a slot as well (like a-point) but it doesn't seem to be present in our documentation.

Ah ok so now the behaviour is that if it is overriden, we will never go back to the original text lists? 

I think that it would be better if we can override it once and then go back to the text list. 

So for example 

```
* Item 1 ``{`` texts="['(a)','(b)','(c)']" ``}``
  * sub level not applied as per norm
* Item 2 ``{`` text="OVERRIDE" ``}``
* Item 3
```

So item 1 will have (a), item 2 will be OVERRIDE and item 3 will be (c) 

What do you think!

```suggestion
    const texts = node.attribs.texts.replace(/'/g, '"');
```

Having this behavior is not really ideal because the user can't even escape the single quote if they want to use this. 

Did some investigation and this code seems to work 
```
const text = node.attribs.texts.replace(/(?<!\\)'/g, '"').replace(/\\'/g, '\'');
```
It basically replaces single quotes with " only if it does not have a escape character in front and then replaces \' with ' so it can be parsed by json. 

One problem is that users need to use double escape characters 
Eg. 
```
* Item 1 ``{`` texts="['(a\\')','(b)','(c)']" ``}``
  * sub level not applied as per norm
* Item 2
* Item 3
* Last text config will be applied when the list length exceeds texts
* Another last text
* You can override like this ``{`` text="OVERRIDE" ``}``
* Another overrided text
```

Could you try and see if this works!

Thanks for the work @yiwen101! Some code quality stuff. 

Some thoughts 
- I think this feature wouldn't be hard to extend for icons as well. Would this be needed @damithc ? 
- What should the expected behavior be if a subsequent bullet point uses ``{``text="OVERRIDE"``}``?

Something like this
```
* Item A ``{`` texts="11,12,13,14" ``}``
* Item B
  * Sub-item B1 ``{`` texts="21,22,23,24" ``}``
  * Sub-item B2 ``{`` text="OVERRIDE" ``}``
  * Sub-item B3
    * Sub-sub-item B3.1 ``{`` texts="31,32,33,34" ``}``
    * Sub-sub-item B3.2
      * Sub-sub-sub-item B3.2.1
  * Sub-item B4
```

would produce this: 
![image](https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/assets/77204346/61aa19dc-6b64-4995-8e2f-f2a5f5a45a1b)
The text is overriden which I think should be the correct behavior - users should be able to override with individual text. But 22 onwards will continue ie we dont skip the it. Should this be the desired behaviour?

```suggestion
   Previously, we used milestones to help manage versions, adding a milestone to an issue once related PRs had been merged. However, there was confusion over the use of milestones and labels and adding a milestone was often forgotten. Hence, ultimately it was not sufficiently useful to the team.

Make a minimal panel

```

Expand and collapse it once 
Expand it again


https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/assets/77204346/416e832d-8c23-4d47-976c-06b92b1258c7

Code in minimal panel: 
```
    minimalToggle() ``{``
      if (this.localExpanded) ``{``
        /*
          This is a collapse.
          Set isHeaderAtBottom to true only at the end of transition.
          So that we can achieve the correct collapse transition effect of minimal panel.
        */
        const onCollapseDone = (event) => ``{``
          if (event.target === this.$refs.panel) ``{``
            this.isHeaderAtBottom = false;
            this.$refs.panel.removeEventListener('transitionend', onCollapseDone);

        this.$refs.panel.addEventListener('transitionend', onCollapseDone);

The onCollapseDone is only triggered upon the second expansion which results in this odd behavior

Thats a good idea Prof! 
Some things from examining our user guide for now 
- Certain formatting results in lack of contrast eg. grey text, inline code, links
- General improper structure of html eg. Page nav is not formatting correct because `&lt;ul>` contains a `&lt;div>` than `&lt;li>` element
- Missing aria-labels in buttons and links
- Missing lang attributes
- Missing alt text in images

For now, it seems the lack of contrast is the biggest violator in general. 
I will make a PR for now just to correct some of these mistakes if possible and then later look into adding web accessibility tools in Markbind for users to use. :)

I sometimes forget to add contributors when they have contributed for the first time. So I was thinking about automating this process. 

### Describe the solution you'd like

One possible solution I found was [all-contributors-auto-action](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/all-contributors-auto-action) which aims to do this. This would need some investigation and testing about how well it works

However, when trying to test using the released version of markbind, it is necessary to unlink (`npm unlink markbind-cli`)from the cli package. This step is not documented in the DG.

> Hi @yucheng11122017, the definition of inactivity for the github action you mentioned is any form of history to the issue, be it labelling, comments or references. What do you think would be a good timeline to unassign? I think 1 week might be too short since some issues can take longer than that before any PRs are made, especially with users juggling multiple issues. Perhaps 10-14 days will be good? I think any longer would be pointless, considering the timeline of a sem.

Hmmm tbh I think a week is good. Even if there is problems opening a PR for the issue, I feel like the person should be at least updating or commenting after a week. 

Is it possible for us to do like after 6 days, ping them to remind them about the issue and the upcoming deadline? Than at 7 days, we unassign. 

One problem that I would be concerned about is the pollution of the issue thread with unnecessary comments, where there are just many reminders with no value add to the conversation.

Hi @damithc! Wondering if using 'copy link to highlight' would be sufficient? For example, 
![image](https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/assets/77204346/34f3f493-87e2-488e-85d0-81477fa4caaa)
Clicking 'copy link to highlight' would produce a link like [this ](https://markbind.org/userGuide/components/navigation.html#dropdown:~:text=%3C!%2D%2DNotice%20how%20header,%3C/div%3E) that already highlights the relevant parts. 
However, this would be more cumbersome for sure because you would have to go to the page and highlight it. The links would also not be dynamically updated as well. 

If trying to quote, I think using includes now may work. 

For example, something like this: 
```
> <include src="userGuide/addingNavigationButtons.md#overview" />
```

would generate

Yeah i think the right click thing seems to be chrome specific UI. But there should be other ways to do this in other browsers as well :)

Right - this boilerplate is currently only used for our documentation. In that case, would it make sense to include some default boilerplates when calling init which includes some of these boilerplates?

Hi! I was thinking of modifying `<a-point>` such that different shapes can be used for annotation. 
So far my thoughts is to add a slot so that users can use their own shapes if they want. 

For example, a user can do this: 
```
<annotate src="../../images/annotateSampleImage.png" width="500" alt="Sample Image">
  &gt;!-- Minimal Point -->
  <a-point x="25%" y="25%" content="This point is 25% from the left and 25% from the top">
    <span class="badge bg-primary">Primary</span>
  </a-point>
</annotate>
```
to achieve something like this. 
![image](https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/assets/77204346/fddcf926-c368-44d4-b77d-b9e5bf65ff25)


If no shape is used, the default button is used (to prevent any breaking changes) 
However, things like size, color and opacity (which is currently used to control the size of the a-point) would no longer work when users use a slot. Instead, they would have to control these things using CSS.

Hi @damithc, you brought up this issue during class this week. From what I understand, you would prefer a button that incrementally expands and collapses panels at each level is that correct? 
So if you have a panel that has a nested panel, pressing the open button once would open the panel at the first level. Pressing it again would open the inner panel. 
Similarly, if you press the close button, the nested panel will close first. Pressing the close button again would then close the panel at the first level. 

It can be a component - similiar to the [scroll-to-top button](https://markbind.org/userGuide/components/navigation.html#scroll-to-top-button) to allow users to choose the icon, position and so on. 

> Imo a button to expand/collapse all panels is good but the second requirement in the thread seems a bit un-authorfriendly if we were to implement it (e.g. authors have to specify a `no-auto-expand-collapse` attribute to exclude certain panels) although it would be nice for readers.

Do you need an opt out option for this button? 

A sample usage might be: 
`&lt;expand-panel-button open-icon="``{``some_icon``}``" close-icon="``{``some_icon``}``" icon-size="``{``some_size``}``" bottom="" right=""/>`
Users can toggle the position to be either relative or absolute (so it will be similiar to the scroll to top button which is always at a fixed position)

Hi I've done some research on this 
1. One way to fix this issue is to call another scrollIntoView when the images have been loaded. But this would need to be done for every single lazy loaded image which is not ideal - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68467475/lazy-loading-conflicting-with-scrollto-anchor-to-id-scroll-stops-halfway-throu 
2. Another way is to call two animations (basically the same as the first but only 2 animations). When the first is ending, hopefully the images would have loaded and hence the second animation would result in correct positioning https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63197942/scrollintoview-not-working-properly-with-lazy-image-load
3. Both method 1 and method 2 are extremely hacky. I think generally the better way is the user to input the height and width so that scrollIntoView can compute properly and hence doesn't get pushed down.  https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/13kcpko/how_to_fix_jscss_scrolling_down_in_the_page_with/

Thanks for pointing this out @damithc! 
It seems like Markbind has two components for images... 
One is using markdown syntax ("images" in the UG) and another is ["picture" ](https://markbind.org/userGuide/components/imagesAndDiagrams.html#pictures). 
I think "image" got included within "formating content" in the UG because it is from markdown. 
Seems like the major difference between the two in terms of usability is that "picture" can add an caption below it, while "images" doesn't support it natively. 

Should we look to combine these two components? Or find a way to reformat it?

Hi @damithc, there is some existing functionality already with the plugin [CodeWrap](https://markbind.org/userGuide/usingPlugins.html#plugin-codeblockwrapbuttons).
If the user has already wrapped the text using the plugin, when printing the wrap is maintained (ie the code is wrapped) 
![image](https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/assets/77204346/282000bc-8335-4969-ad89-69d00076f7db)

Otherwise, it is as shown in your display. 
Would it be sufficient to make wrapping text the default behaviour when this is plugin is enabled so that when users print, it should already be wrapped unless chosen to do so? 
Or should be code will be wrapped as long as there is printing? (regardless of whether this plugin is enabled and whether or not the wrap text button was clicked)

Hi @Tim-Siu have you experimented with this? I'm wondering how accurate will the calculation be of the indentation..

Hi @Tim-Siu, the latter two sound good. 
I'm not too sure about the first point though - whether we would want code wrapping to be the default setting instead of a plugin. Maybe anyone else would care to input? 
In the meantime, you can do a PR for the latter two first that would be great!

Hi @yiwen101, before you get started on this issue, please do read this part of the user guide ! https://markbind.org/userGuide/reusingContents.html#importing-variables-from-other-external-file-formats

There is already some support from creating tables from csv files but currently is very clunky and not intuitive as you can see. 
But you might be able to reuse some of the logic and code that already supports some of this parts

> Hi; initially I plan to implement a new component called table; but (credit to yucheng for pointing out relevant existing features)later I realize that we already could bring csv file as an external virable, and after reading the current code (lib/nunjucks-extension, ver-components/src/panels and html/includePanelProcessor), I do not think I could bring a significant improvement over the current feature.

Hi @yiwen101 have you spoken to prof about this issue? I think he still has some issues with the usability of this feature. Yes it supposed external importing but it isn't very intuitive or easy to use which is why he opened this issue.

> @kaixin-hc The list customization is both a significant and a unique feature we have but it is currently buried under list formatting which is a commonplace feature that every static site generator has. People wouldn't even know about it unless they specifically started looking for such a feature. I think we can sell it as a separate feature with its own name.

An extension to this as discussed today by @KevinEyo1 and I is to remind mergers to tick if it is missing. 

Unlike the missing commit message PR, because this step only occurs at the end, a reminder might be more appropriate than failing a status check. This is open for discussion though!

Hmm should it be split by `,`? What if the text itself has `,` inside or other seperators? Is it possible to use an array instead for this attribute? 

Does this need to be applied for other things as well like icons?

Also, if the user only specifies 2 things, but there are 3 in the list, it should inherit from the last item right.

> Icons already follow a 'repeat until changed' logic. Text doesn't have any such logic.

@damithc text also has the same logic as icons! It will be repeated until it is changed. Same for other text attributes. 

I think probably the best way going forward is 

- texts is an array eg. ["a", "b", "c"]
- The last item will be used to continue if there is insufficient items
- It will only apply to the same level (similiar logic to currently) 
eg. 
```
* item 1 ``{`` texts="(a),(b),(c)" ``}``
  * sub level
* item 2
* item 3
```

will make the bullet points for item 1, 2, 3 (a), (b) and (c) respectively. 
sub level's bullet will be non customised.

I am closing off this PR as I am rethinking the approach. 

Right now, markbind SSR is very complicated with a lot of undocumented non-trivial approaches to enable SSR.
I think that the effort to migrate everything in one go and ensure that there will be no critical bugs would be immense.

So, I think that a more appropriate measure would be that we make it such that we can use both concurrently.
(eg. allow vue3 components to be used without affecting the current vue2 setup) which would allow us to
1. Create new components in Vue 3.
2. Slowly and carefully migrate component from Vue 2 and Vue 3 (if needed).

This approach would be better but I would need investigate the feasibility of having two systems together.

I think all in all looks okay to me from my testing. It seems that the style and script is hosited for Externals correctly. Feel free to chime in as I may have missed something!

1. For the code cov check failure, we can ignore it right? (as externals is not tested in the first place)
2. I think one point I am concerned about is that the style get hoisted so it becomes global to the page. So, lets say you make H1 red, it will become global to the page. Do you think we needed to add this the documentation? Since, I think it might be unexpected behaviour for most people. (Would there be unexpected consequence of a global hositing?)

I think that I am not sure how useful that attribute would be. It would completely disable the style and script for that external component. What do you think?

>Meanwhile, s commented in https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/issues/2300, probably worth opening a new issue on "finding a more proper fix that retains the script element placement instead of hoisting it downward." as well?

For CSS wise,  it is global because the styling is not unique to the element. 

For script wise, I am not super sure whether it matters whether element placment matters (I do see that maybe we want the script to trigger when the element is shown but I do not think that this is trivial to implement).

Looks correct on my end. For the indentation rule can you check on whether we can get a replacement? 
> 2. Do I need to change anything in the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file? If not, is it because Github Actions will run the `ci.yml` in my code which uses the updated dependencies.

I dun think so? We still run `npm run test` command  in CI? (There is no change right?) If any change, you should change our test command.

I agree that if you can fix and ensure that this new style is standardised in current code base then it is good to go.


> 4. Not sure why some css files are included in `.stylelintignore`, could someone explain the purpose of it? Thanks!
1. min.css is ignored because it is minified and will not follow the standards
2. _site is the css in templates and should not be linted.
3. coverage and test should not be linted
4. Vue components folder also has coverage folder. Maybe you can specify just the coverage folder? I dun think our vue components folder has css files. (Double check)

Hi @yucheng11122017,

I tested the changes on my end wdyt of the requested changes?
From my observations
1. If you look at the annotatepoint, it is waiting for it to be fully mounted before rendering (waiting for isMounted flag to fully render). 
So, the solution I used wait for dom changes. It works but I think it might not be the recommended practice. (I think it is fine since it is deterministic)
You can try other methods from here (I think other methods do not really wait for child component to be mounted. So, I am not sure if there are any other methods) https://v1.test-utils.vuejs.org/guides/testing-async-components.html

2. v-postpover = dropdown from floating-vie

@Tim-Siu 
It generally looks good to me. Thanks for implementing this.
There is a concern on my end tho.

It seems like once you trigger printing then the CSS remains thus the line numbers. In my opinion, it is not easy to undo it. (Prob hacky to undo it). What do you think? If it is too hard and not worthwhile, maybe can ask damith what he thinks about this side effect.

Do add documentation. (Also this side effect if we are going with this)

I think you are not showcasing what is this supposed to be used for ```{`` text="Step 2", class="text-warning" ``}```. (Sort of like using step2 as an icon)

i-size and t-size is not isolated for each icon unless you set each of the manually. (So if you set 1 with t-size, it will affect the whole list.)

I think this is not explained in the documentation. I would lean towards this as a bug rather than a lack of documentation.

Should we fix this or create a new ticket hmmm?

I realised the first t-size and i-size one will affect the next ones on the same level is sort of intended.  The styling is just carried down the levels. I think the documentation mentioned `If you customize any item on a certain level, you must also customize the first item on that level. If not, the list will revert to its uncustomized form.`

I think this is too vague. Do you think we should explain this behaviour in more depth? (I think that this is more of a docs issue rather than bug now)

I like the idea but I feel that it might not be related to the scope of this PR right? Unless you mean change to icon and also using text with the icon?

I think for now I am okay with what we are doing right now.
I checked our repository for `export type` and I realised we dun really have much types and references in the first place. 

I am leaning more towards against this change. (due to the fact that we do not have much types and we do not often nid to reference the typing.) 

I feel that even if we want to do this, we should create a separate and do the 1 time migration PR rather than doing it first on this PR so that our repository is more coherent.

What do @yucheng11122017 @kaixin-hc think about this?

I think the docs is okay and we can add it.

Though I am thinking whether we should add this because this is not the only way.
I was thinking whether this will make them think this is the only right way.

Another possible way which I do is:
For me I add both remote repositories (upstream and origin(fork)) then I just sync them up via cli.

@yiwen101 

I think I am okay with this method if you really cannot find a better way but you may need to rename it since it does not really print but return the string of the hashmap.

I think it is possible to create a class that extends from SiteLinkManager in the test file right that has the getter? Do you think this will work and fix the issue?

@yiwen101 
Thank you for implementing this!

The implementation looks good to me!

I tested it on my end and it seems to be working well! 
I did not realise any noticable slow down at all!

One thing I realised is that we can add the function documentation (and also improve the old ones if needed) what do you think? For instance functions like `setHeadingId`. I think we should maintain a good amount of function documentation!

 @LamJiuFong correct me if I am wrong.
I thinkis trying to comment out the variables so that it will not be rendered as stated earlier. As what he is trying to do is to put nunjunks variables on top of the template then render it. To load the nunjucks variables.

If variables is not commented, then it will be rendered.

@LamJiuFong 
I would prefer it if it is in the same file as that is sort of the problem highlighted that we want nunjucks to be supported in variables.md. I am wondering whether it is possible to remove the variables before processing it with nunjucks? Or maybe not rendering it in the first place.

I was just thinking why are we using the cdn version of mermaid. I read yongliang's old PR and he did that too?

Is the reasoning be such that we want Vue to have access of mermaid and it is not trivial to do it? Either way, we should document the rationale!

Yea. It also gave me the impression that you need to input it but it is actually optional. You can make it more clear that this configuration is only needed if you want to change the mermaid cdn url.

I agree with @yucheng11122017 .

I feel that test cases that are too big makes it very hard to read (which affects future maintainability). I think that simpler test cases will not necessary reduce the robustness of the testcase. 
I think this is simple and low impact that I would prefer simpler testcases.

I am thinking whether we can make it such that it is better to integrate more checks? Currently it feels as though for future we will do something similar and I think if we do cheerio.load for every check it is gonna take a while longer.

Is it possible to make it such that 1 cheerio.load for multiple checks in the future without refactoring the whole code in the future (when we implement new checks)

I am thinking whether we can introduce bun just for testing and setting up which will improve dev experience.
I think that Lerna can work with running bun but I am not 100% sure so we need to investigate.

Out of curiosity, I tested bun on markbind-cli.  When I did that serve -d, it does not work (error).
From how I feel, the perfomance gain is negligible when I tested markbind serve. 

I think that for this maybe we can just focus on markbind run setup and test. (So, the dependency is on dev's end rather than users)

 v5.5.2
error: The "path" argument must be of type string. Received undefined
```

To reproduce run markbind deploy locally. It worked for me on WSL2 but it seems like it may not be working for Windows. Note: once we set the cache_dir env variable it will work.

### Expected behavior

Should work without the need to explicitly setting cache_dir

### Anything else?

We updated gh-pages and it started to not work. Related to this update which introduced the cache folder. Related to the v3.1.0 update for github pages.

I think the deployment commands may change (get deprecated) and is not feasible for us to update it constantly.

I think that it is not complex to deploy with CLI commands (related to your provider) especially if you have deployed and configured it once before.

I recently closed an old PR that had been pending for some time. After considerable reflection and discussions, I've come to believe that a more effective approach might be to support both Vue 2 and Vue 3 simultaneously as we transition away from Vue 2.

Upon reviewing my code and taking into account the insights from discussions and @ang-zeyu's comments, it's become evident that my understanding of the intricate details involved in our current SSR system is limited. (There are a lot of like implementation that I do not understand why and is not well documented.) Undertaking a comprehensive migration single-handedly seems overly ambitious, and the complexity of the task might pose a barrier for others who wish to contribute.

In light of these considerations, and following discussions with Yongliang, I propose that we maintain support for both Vue 2 and Vue 3 concurrently. This approach would allow for a more gradual and meticulous migration from the old component system to the new one. Eventually, this would lead to a complete phase-out of the Vue 2 system once the migration is fully accomplished.

I have been exploring Astro as a potential model for this approach. Given that Astro supports SSR for multiple frameworks simultaneously, it might offer valuable insights or strategies that we could adapt for our project.

I was looking at the Github actions. And I think one of them failed in Nov 2023 due to this.
It seems that this is still prevalent. So, I think anyone can take this up if they want to.

- [ ] Increase timeout for jest tests. Also, investigate and see how much we need to increase. (Note: timeout prevents test suite for running too long and if we increase it by too much => may allow for test that is super long to exist)
- [ ] Monitor and close this issue when we no longer see windows ci test failing due to this.

@yucheng11122017 
I agree. Both of them are different and have different syntax. 
Maybe we can disambiguate and help the users out?

I think we can solve it by linking them to one another.
For example, in the markdown syntax image, we can say that if you want to add a caption to your image, you can refer to the image component.

Then for the image component, we can say that if you want to create a clickable image please refer to the markdown syntax image?

It's quite silly but when I thought about it I wasn't sure if I liked the look of it being being bolded and a link 😂 I was also thinking about if the user would expect it to link to something within the MarkBind website and be taken by surprise by a link that goes out

Thanks for your review!

After investigation, tests are failing due to a mismatch between expected files and generated files. [We can refer to this PR](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48469675/clearing-the-pipeline-cache-with-gitlab-ci). This is because in `packages/cli/test/functional/testSites.js`, a list of plantuml files that are expected in test-site are saved, and in the compare function the existence of these ignored files is checked for before all ignored files are filtered out and compared.

However, in this line `compare(siteName, 'expected', '_site', siteName === 'test_site' ? plantumlGeneratedFiles : []);` essentially plantuml files are only checked for in test_site.

I'll make a separate issue about fixing this, and we can merge this chore once this section has been improved.

Do you think this section still has any use? I was thinking about the current example of the CS2103T websites having the textbook embedded when I wrote this section. While you might archive versions of the textbook, if you also archived versions of the 2103 website, would it be important to note that when navigating to the textbook files it would show the textbook as it was at the point of archiving and you might not see the most recent version of the textbook?

It's kind of niche, but I wasn't sure if it would be an unexpected behaviour for the user.

Mm, I agree with you, its just that I haven't implemented CLI commands to manage this yet so it might become necessary to edit it as a stopgap measure (changing the name of versions, for example, or deleting versions). I think using CLI commands to support renaming, deletion and maybe moving would be ideal, but might be outside the scope of this PR? Though I don't think it would be too difficult!

I believe I did reference this section of baseUrlMap, but because I needed an additional map, and was referencing different paths and everything, I thought the additional complexity of extracting it and abstracting this function for re-use would actually make it less maintainable 😅 But if I'm misunderstanding do let me know!

I have implemented tests for the new functionality (just unit tests) and I think this PR may be sufficient to stand alone. Other changes since the last review 
- Documentation changes as requested
- Version flag for building and serving now leads to no sites being deployed. 
- Fixed bugs involving file paths/non posix style code for windows

Okay! Just to update that I've revisited the code and these comments to some extent and I think the original principles were sound, but the refactoring done since when I first worked on this and now is making the merge quite painful, which is why there's been some delay; but I'll make the fixes either here or in a fresh PR.

Just read this thread and the accompanying one -- While I think release-drafter looks cool and the existing functionalities you describe also sound interesting, I am very happy with the idea of relying on the format by GitHub. After all, both would require a slight change in our workflow, and a change to use something closer to default GitHub release notes feels more "default" and intuitive, if that makes sense. I am not sure we lose much by doing away with the categories -- and if we need the issue number we could click on the PR and to the issue through that?

Hi @WillCWX ! Took a look at this. You might not have noticed but codecov/patch is failing - I think the area that you are refactoring did not have tests. In this case since the overall project coverage didn't drop and a manual review of the code on my part looks okay, I'll merge this so that you can work on #2308 . But when you're over there, please check the tests for site.js and try to increase the coverage.

While these few lines might seem trivial, adding unit tests to cover them would help greatly especially with refactors like these, reducing the time needed for manual review and increasing our confidence in approving these changes.

@damithc thanks for the great suggestions! @jingting1412 has already deployed it here if you want to take a look: https://portfolio-template-markbind.netlify.app/ - though not on GitHub pages.

I'm personally not sure about the NUS/SoC customization - when its more clearly a placeholder, they're more likely to remember to change it, but if it looks close to "finished" you might forget to change it. But definitely think we can make it a _computer science_ portfolio page - especially in things like examples.

I second @ckcherry23 's suggestion to find a nice place to incorporate GitHub stats / reposense stats. It's a cool way to point at other NUS OSS projects.

One more nit - the link shouldn't be blank and yet look the same as the other working links. I'm OK to merge this first though and make a separate issue for improving this section of the documentation to have demo/modals and to fix this button.

Earlier photo is particularly confusing because it is Not using PUML... Can also consider using PUML instead of an image to show how it is incorporated?

Good to show both tip type boxes and info type boxes - you can consider where you can show other type of boxes ah.

One thought I have is that you might want to consider having these components in separate pages so that the scrolling is less painful. But if this is the format expected in 2103T, then lets stick with that. You might want to consider reducing the content even further though

On thinking more, this usage of variable doesn't make much sense to me. Essentially you've shown a use of variable that just includes a hardcoded image of a person in global variables - but the usage here seems to imply its some method of formatting ANY image when it only has that one image.

I can think of two alternatives to demonstrate usage of variable
1. Have something "fancy" saved into the variable and use it somewhere else, like IDK some sort of ASCII divider or image that you might want to "reuse" throughout the website. This is probably simplest to show code reuse.
2. The code example in the user guide is that of ``{`` year ``}`` . This makes sense because you might want to have a "last updated" year or a moving deadline that you update one place which then updates anywhere. If you can think of a good way to represent this I think this would also be interesting.

**Review Status:** CHANGES_REQUESTED

A few polish notes and suggestions for improvement. Some of it (like site nav) I'm quite flexible on the solution - but I want it to be clear for the user what files are default-populated, otherwise it is likely some files with non-project related information will continue to float around.

For this purpose, content / filler text can be substantially reduced unless it is demonstrating markbind features. 

Other features, like popover, popup, panels, can be explored so that it is easy for users to copy-paste an example from the project documentation. For example, feature information might be contained in panels to make the page more scrollable. I invite you to figure out where you can add on!

The overall structure (user guide, dev guide, etc) is good. I think it just needs more polish before merging.

It feels like the main issue is what if it wraps line numbers the user does not expect to wrap (since not all languages consider indents the same way as python). If we force this change for all wrapping when clicked regardless of users settings, I'm not sure yet that there would be no undesired behaviour.

If when printing, not wrapping and wrapping but no line numbers both often distort the meaning unexpectedly ... Then I agree with Elton that a change made only for print makes sense? In other words when printing code blocks will auto wrap and add line numbers, otherwise it will follow existing behaviours.

Another alternative (but breaking) might be to have all code blocks automatically have line numbers that must be manually disabled, which would cause the default behaviour to be "correct" when printing if not otherwise overriden. But it's probably not worth making a breaking change for this.

Thanks for the additional context prof! Found #1671 where this is discussed and #1734 .

**TLDR**: agree about softwrapping with line numbers for overflowing code on print (but no change for non overflowing code) makes sense because it helps to avoid changing/losing the meaning of the code, which is the worst part in thr status quo.

### Additional rambles on alternative 2:

Alternative 2, which is what I believe this PR is suggesting is followed on several websites. GitHub has line numbers and softwraps all code on mobile; but in the MarkBind context this might not make sense:

Wrapped (Github)             |  Not wrapped (MarkBind)
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
<img src="https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/assets/59471320/901ec30e-d9d1-4a87-a0e9-ef0581c61d08" height="600">  |  <img src="https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/assets/59471320/e3fd13e2-1719-44c8-8811-21e07ffe11f1" height="600">


Admittedly, in cases like that (an ASCII image that overflows the page size) whether it softwraps on printing or not it will still look weird, and is a rare edge case.

After doing some reading, it seems no line numbers is (frequently) preferred from a UX perspective([discussion 1 (ux exchange)](https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/81060/why-are-line-numbers-in-text-editors-and-programming-ides-so-often-disabled-by-d), [discussion 2 (reddit)](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/45caqh/why_dont_people_use_line_numbers/)), but individuals often have the opposite preference...

So I'm hesitant to say all code wrapped blocks should enable line numbers. If you wrap the code and the meaning doesn't change when you think it's a hard line break instead of a soft line break, I can see why a user who doesn't like line numbers would still want line numbers to be disabled even with code wrapped. Having the numbers go back on would be unexpected (and breaking?)

Tests for externals seem outside of the scope of this issue. For now, you can flag a separate issue to add tests for this and reduce the code coverage patch expected instead, so that the tests will pass.

Actually this is my bad. I saw this in a previous PR as well - your project coverage is the same even though the patch coverage dropped, and as you have observed this is because externals was not tested in the first place. So the changed lines in diff are flagged as not tested. 

No action is needed for this on your part; it passes CI so maintainers can merge it anyway. Sorry for the confusion!

The understanding I have is that when this code was written, the browsers required prefixing for these due to not supporting the properties unprefixed. Stylelint relies on autoprefixer, an open source project that automatically adds prefixes when needed.

The implication here is that the prefixes are no longer needed due to them being supported by the browser at this point, though they were not supported in the past.

Hence, assuming there is no change in behaviour, I think we should keep the rule and change the CSS.

Yay, thanks for the tests!

The issue https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/issues/2203 also raises the example of the footnote in reader facing features. However, this is not fixed by your PR (is it because the new line isn't there?)

Can you also fix this documentation bug to demonstrate that this feature works?

Agree that this isn't really super clear that text is being used in place of an icon. It just kinda looks like the icon is removed?

I don't know how uncustom bullet point will look... But I will say I think it looks really strange to have no bullet point. It doesn't look like a list at all, and if the number of items continue, wouldn't it just look like a paragraph? :// Not a big fan

In general I like the idea of more customisability and this looks robust! Especially being able to use emoji (maybe you could demonstrate it in the docs?)

One reservation I have is that the text of the list and the text of the bullet point feel misaligned. But perhaps this can be looked at in another PR...

Your example looks legitimate, but isn't really convincing as to why I can't just type it out in text rather than changing the bullet point... 😅 

Maybe you can do something with emojis, or a pro-con list? And you might need to identify clearly what is being used...

Great investigation! @yucheng11122017 - perhaps you can implement the fix @Tim-Siu suggests, and then include a documentation note that there are known errors with printing on Edge and Firefox? 

In terms of if we should fix it for Firefox/Edge, though it would be nice to figure out why and support it, if printing is OK on Chrome and Safari I think it is OK to deprioritise this (since a brief google search claims 70% of people are on Chrome or safari, with only 7% on Edge or Firefox)

Maybe can discuss in #2397 - probably related

I'll take a look at the rest of this later - but for the scrollbar fix, I think without isolating why it's happening, this CSS suppression feels a bit hacky to me. At very least maybe you should leave a comment above those lines of code to point to this issue so that if someone reads the code later they'll know when this surfaces - I can easily imagine someone removing what looks like superfluous CSS leading to a code regression

My bad @yiwen101 ! While generally you can press update this branch, you need to take particular care for typescript migration due to our established workflow, and I didn't realize the context when I gave that advice

(I think if you had clicked update this branch with rebase it would have been okay)

 Normally, it doesn't matter because PRs are squash-merged, but in this case it does since we're trying to preserve the doc history.

I'm OK with this I think - though I remember some discussions about spy-on vs mock, where mock tends to be preferred over spying as errors can't be produced from winston. 

Here is some additional discussions on stack overflow for your consideration...

Hi Yiwen! Instead of git merge master followed by git merge rebase - you should be able to git rebase master, which would properly rebase it off of master. 

What you did was rebase the last two commits on the same branch - I'm not totally sure what that does TBH, its not a common use and perhaps not an intended one

> Under discussion as to how the visual issue is intended to work. Considering the original intension is to consider a list with icons and to ensure that every item in the list to have an icon, one suggestion I have is perhaps we can just display an icon for the items that you dont want an icon, where the icon looks like the bullet point of the unordered list.

NIT: Since this text is overridden - maybe you can change the overridden text to "lorum ipsum" or something like in the other tests? This was confusing to me because I didn't realise the difference between what was overridden for a while.

It's an open-ended thought - looking for ideas. I think more encouragement early on can be good for newer contributors? But I'm also not certain on implementation

**Review Status:** COMMENTED

No comments on implementation, which I think looks good now!

However, I don't love the look of the commit message. Is there a reason why we're pinging the contributor and asking them to ask to be recognised? It feels less friendly. I'm OK with it if we also amend the readme/expectations as well.

Also, I was thinking that this is essentially a "welcome" message to the repository of sorts. It might be nice to also use this to recognise and welcome the contributor even more, the same way some other OSSes have decided to work. Something like [what scribeOS does? see this reflection](https://nus-cs3281.github.io/2024/cs3282-index.html#project-scribe-ios)

what do @MarkBind/active-devs think?

Edit: I realise this might be confusing bc of [my previous comment](https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/issues/2457#issuecomment-1994573833) on the issue, but I'd like to clarify my issue isn't with asking contributors to add themselves, but that the only place where recognition is talked about is asking contributor to add themselves. I personally would find it scary and wonder if a mistake was made, and people might be scared to ask for recognition or feel like their work is not recognised. Other repos which adopt asking contributors to add themselves make it part of the PR checklist and devdocs / readme so that it's clear its part of regular expectations. Otherwise, I think a reminder nudge _to the person who merged the PR / active devs_ is the way to go!

Thanks for the extensibility considerations! I can definitely see it the code and I agree with the overall approach.

I second @/yucheng11122017 's comments though on whether we can use a constructor. I also don't like the idea of the pushRuleAndReset, because I feel like it opens the possibility where someone forgets to push a rule and maybe one of the other setter functions and then you don't get a well formed rule. If the user is expected to call all of those functions, it makes sense to me that they are all called at once.

@yiwen101 Thanks for sharing your reasoning! Yes, it was a good surprise to me as well how robust current browsers are.

As shared in earlier comments I have some issues with the code in this "over-engineered" form. I support a PR specifically targeting "table body missing" especially if it's a small change; we can always change the code that checks this if we discover that there are more cases we must check.

1. Lines 3-5 : can you also update in this PR? Version of bootstrap relied on + Maybe delete line 5, which seems too repetitive. 
2. I never noticed before how repetitive these instructions are. I wonder if there is a better way to streamline the instructions? Hmm. Maybe a tooltip or something to see some different example icons would be cool.

I've taken a video for your reference that shows that toggling these properties would make a visual difference. The caret button seems to also be a seamless button which appears when the panel is minimised, so the non seamless panels and the seamless panels then have slightly different styling due to this line of code.

When embedded, it seems like the warning is very large and disrupts the flow of the text. Actually, even when it's not included the placing feels a little awkward. What if all or some of the content was in an expandable panel, so that it's out of the way? Just the header might be good? I suppose you could also experiment with having the example be expandable instead.

This makes sense to me in theory, but given that the sample couplings you have here are package.json and either lerna or babel, which is not a TestOrDoc file, I think reading this code is confusing. Maybe we should name it as "dependent files" or something?

Or maybe this isn't such a good example of a coupling? You could put site and site test maybe 🤔

i am concerned about people not checking console logs for CI, its a lot more troublesome and honestly wouldn't occur to me. But since this is a piece by piece implementation and you've mentioned you'd like to look at generating an automated list of reliant files, I think it is OK for now

Thanks for working on this @jingting1412 ! Would you revise the issue description so it is easier for teammates people to review? I think screenshots/video will help :)

Comparing the new appearance against the old, I think that the sticky header and working PUML are [actually already in the live dev docs](https://teammates.github.io/teammates/) - so **the only "change" in the UI is the breadcrumbs** (as auto-breadcrumbs being a MarkBind feature added in 5.0). Is that correct? (if it is, maybe can separate out the UI change from your explanations of why the other code changed 😅 

I understand that the `variables` file is not used on the teammates website and `variables.json` does not exist. Perhaps we should remove this file? (TEAMMATES people, if this is considered an unrelated change we can also file an issue and open a separate PR - let us know!)

### What is the area that this feature belongs to?

Author Usability, Documentation

### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

Users considering what template to use have no visual reference of the difference between templates. As we make this "quickstart" more fully featured, we should have working, meaningful demos - or at minimum some sort of visual reference for users to make a decision of what template suits them

### Describe the solution you'd like

Minimal: on this page: https://markbind.org/userGuide/templates.html include modals/popups or tooltips with a screenshot of each template

More developed: Have a section with MarkBind demos that describe and use these templates and link that. One OSS project I think does this well, React-Admin has a great demos page: https://marmelab.com/react-admin/Demos.html which talks about the features in each demo, links a working demo, and also links the source code.

(node:2418) [DEP0040] DeprecationWarning: The `punycode` module is deprecated. Please use a userland alternative instead.

This is also flagged if you npm run test and read through the logs.

### Expected behavior

We shouldn't get a deprecation error.

### Anything else?

I don't think this is an issue with (most) of markbind things, but rather something from node. My node version is Node.js v21.7.1 . [See this issue on yarn...](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/9005)

> The History section of [DEP0040](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v21.x/docs/api/deprecations.html#DEP0040) in the Node.js documentation shows that Node.js punycode has been deprecated since Node.js [v7.0.0](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v7.0.0) in Oct 2016 and, starting with Node.js [v21.0.0](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v21.0.0), this has been changed to a runtime deprecation (see https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/47202). The runtime deprecation is what has caused it to now become visible. 

Potential options:
- We might decide not to do anything about this, it doesn't affect functionality yet
- Switch to node LTS version, which apparently does not have this error
- ?

Aside from node, it seems punycode is also a dependency for tough-cookie and two others> Not sure if we can move away from this.

M2 Mac v13.6.6

### MarkBind version

5.4.0

### Describe the bug and the steps to reproduce it

When running `npm install` in the root of markbind, see the following error:
<img width="538" alt="node-gyp error" src="https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/assets/59471320/7153215d-8717-42d7-8cbc-b73800de7a04">

This error is caused because 3.12 python deprecates distutils, and node-gyp packaged with LTS is a node-gyp version before version 10. As stated in [this issue](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/issues/2942), python 3.12 needs the newer version of node-gyp. It seems non trivial to update node-gyp version, as the [official instructions here did not work for me](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/blob/main/docs/Force-npm-to-use-global-node-gyp.md) (needs more testing).

However, one workaround that worked for me was adding the following line to node config 
`python=path/to/python/on/my/device` and downgrading my python version (`brew uninstall python@3.12` - though i had to force uninstall it due to dependencies)

(I also had to delete and reclone my MarkBind, but I suspect that was unrelated)

### Expected behavior

If the versions are not supported, we should maybe warn users of the problem since right now we just say the following about required version...

5.4.0 (latest)

### Describe the bug and the steps to reproduce it


After investigation, tests fail [in this PR](https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/pull/2497) due to a mismatch between expected files and generated files. [We can refer to this PR](https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/blob/da0cd19097dd6454f71122ba0aa3a5a2a8c685c2/packages/cli/test/functional/test.js#L34) where the relevant changes were made. This is because in `packages/cli/test/functional/testSites.js`, a list of plantuml files that are expected in test-site are saved, and in the compare function the existence of these ignored files is checked for before all ignored files are filtered out and compared.

However, in this line `compare(siteName, 'expected', '_site', siteName === 'test_site' ? plantumlGeneratedFiles : []);` essentially plantuml files are only checked for in test_site.

This is not scalable for other generated images in sites that aren't test-site, and means that this image cannot be ignored as per the instructions in the dev-guide without breaking CI workflows. This was not discovered until now because PUML files were not tested outside of test-site before, but since we currently maintain test sites for the templates which are available for users (and it is not reasonable to expect us not to have PUML in these templates), we should change the status quo.

### Expected behavior

We should rewrite this section to allow for files to be ignored in any section. We should also leave a comment in the .gitignore and/or in the dev guide to also update a list within the site test files which is passed into this function.

Perhaps using a dictionary with keys being the site_names and the values being an array of ignored files. Then the value passed into compare can be something like:
> `ignoredFilesList = ignoredFiles.site_name if site_name in ignoredFiles.keys() else []`  

(syntax not accurate at all).

True - Though we don't define "subsite" anywhere, or properties of subsites. 

And I realise this didn't come up in my search because the term here is sub-site rather than subsite. Hmm. We should probably also standardise usage. Dashed is probably better.

Go to the link in our readme, which throws a site not found error https://markbind-master.netlify.com/

### Expected behavior

The same thing you see here: https://master--markbind-master.netlify.app/

### Anything else?

It works if you replace the URL ending with .app:
* https://markbind-master.netlify.com/
* https://markbind-init-typical.netlify.app/

Quick fix - just change the URLs haha

(Tangent - is the typical output of init saved anywhere? I wonder if we can just adapt that repository to a simple page where you can see the available output of init with different templates)

For copy link to highlight -- this only works on Chrome! Though it does direct you to the right place on the page with other navigation, so there is not a strong negative effect when using it.

I agree that using includes for quoting sections - potentially within a modal or popover on text, if you don't want it so visibly - would be a good use of includes. (though @yucheng11122017 you might want to reupload your image file)

After using revealJS (make slides in HTML and share them as a website),  it seems the sharing of the slides can also only be done with a zipped up folder, or with a PDF export. Then the slides can be seen by clicking index.html . The difference with sharing the markbind folder is that the student would have to have markbind installed and run markbind serve (more steps and hence inconvenient).

Converting website to app sounds pretty troublesome to me - we'd need to make sure it runs on various OS, and I personally hate the idea of downloading an app just to see one particular set of content. With the book analogy, the nice thing about epub is its a recognisable format you can view with many different readers/send around your diff devices, which doesn't really apply to an app. (Though the advantage I suppose would be this would also be a one-step process to click to open an app, I could see people easily running into issues with it not being supported on certain versions, etc)

I think if future batches wanted to support this, they could also look into enhancing PDF export (Exporting the whole website as a set of PDF or making that easier could be useful for course guides, textbooks, references etc) or figuring out an export command which allows the recipient to just double-click a HTML file to open as website.

After discussion in class with @damithc , we decided that we will implement a "product roadmap" on github projects + revisit the dev guide to see if the 'product vision' is sufficient. Will update here when the project makes sense and then close this issue; till then we can have discussion here.

The [project](https://github.com/orgs/MarkBind/projects/1) will try to roughly show our targets for this semester + a selection of prioritised issues, which will hopefully also help new contributors know where they can start. 

As part of this, we will also aim to document use of projects and milestones as per https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/issues/2142

Quick review after using this roadmap the past two months: 

23 issues were prioritised and completed with this roadmap, with 27 remaining. Of these, 15 are discussion / KIV issues, which have questions that are not fully resolved.

Overall, I think dividing issues to do into implementation needed for straightforward tasks and KIV helped to prioritise work over the course of the semester. Using the inbuilt tool was useful to get the whole team on the same page, and we can perhaps continue doing this with a fresh road map next year

Trying to understand the relevance of this issue 6 years on is a bit tricky due to the changes since then. Let me summarise what I figured out...

TLDR - this proposal is no longer relevant

### OG State of issue (above comments)
`vue-strap` was being maintained as a separate fork. #411 and #245 talk mainly about the inconveniences of working with a separate fork (eg - having to manually copy over, duplicating docs, etc and the reasoning behind it especially when the original repository was unmaintained. Our fork became quite markbind specific and fairly tightly coupled to markbind.

In June 2020, vue-strap was merged in as a scoped package `vue-components` 

### After migration
3 components (Modals, Tooltips, Popovers were migrated to bootstrap-vue, which was at that time actively maintained) Triggers might have been migrated but they don't seem to be any more. The summary of discussion in [this comment in #1332](https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/pull/1332#issuecomment-743769904) includes several of the concerns at the time as well as the reasoning and the decision not to depend on bootstrap-vue but rather implement the features we want from boostrap vue for 1) flexibility with our own components 2) increased coupling and complexity -- particularly as certain features (dropdowns, navbars) are already pretty markbind specific/dependent.

### Current state
Then, with bootstrap getting bumped to v5. bootstrap-vue did not support v5, but the v5 features were useful to MarkBind. Hence, in 2022, Modals were migrated to depend on vue-modal and tooltips and popovers were switched to floating vue - as this provided additional reactivity and prevented ssr issues. 

MarkBind was bumped to Bootstrap v5. bootstrap-vue still does not support v5, and hasn't had a commit for 10 months. I think we can conclude this is unlikely. Furthermore, with vue-strap incorporated as a markbind scoped package we no longer face the inconveniences that motivated this issue.

So I'll close this issue now!

Discord isn't truly "open" - moving things to an alternative platform might feel like more hoops to jump through before contributing. I do like Discord though.

Personally I am against a public discussion channel (besides ofc this issue tracking) until the need becomes clearer - we would need to make sure it is maintained and checked and active, which may be difficult

It's true most contributors are on telegram... but telegram sucks for anonymous communication, which I think would be a big deterrent.

Would also support moving away from Slack for internal communications haha. Out of these options Discord is probably the best, but I still think the context should be archived, tracked, referenced and communicated within the issue tracker.

In the docs we already have this line

> You can use Tree in combination with inline Markdown or inline HTML elements.

and also

> Currently, Pop-Ups(tooltip/trigger) are not supported within a tree component.

as an alert. I think this is sufficient (though I wouldn't be opposed to further refining the wording)

I think at present, it is not necessary to explore also supporting this as it looks troublesome without much benefit? Would welcome more opinions.

After reading the thread, and looking at the screenshot, one of the original issues were the bottom buttons were cut off, making a ppt embed unusable on mobile. This has since been fixed, and the simple solution chosen was the simple one of the ppt embeds being a fixed size that the user should scroll to view.

Here's a video of what it looks like now, just to make it clearer: 

https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/assets/59471320/41070c4a-e3d0-4216-90dd-d28a9c2fc086

[This comment](https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/pull/1797#discussion_r900702912) is the one linked in this PR, proposing the alternate solution requested in this issue and some additional areas to look at in the future. The discussion also spanned "usability" vs "looking nicer" - my own two cents is that the current solution is pretty usable, and additional effort might necessarily lead to a better solution. 

Unless someone has particular interest in taking this up to explore CSS, I think we can argue that this isn't a bug to be fixed anymore and just a product decision.

I agree this is super useful. Though part of the difficulty is that even the 3282 team members (like myself) do not have access to update github teams with members...  Good protection to have that kind of role-based access, but we would also need to amend role permissions since this is not something handled by most.

(And if it's only handled by whoever is the maintainer at the time + @damithc , I am not sure if it should be on the developer docs)

To summarise this discussion with crosslinks (and also add my own opinion on how this should be implemented in _italics_)

- [x] Remove the "full syntax reference page" due to 1) duplication with cheat sheet _2) user is more likely to refer via cheatsheet, search function, or original page._
- [x] Rename "Syntax Cheatsheet" to "Syntax Reference, add a note ["to inform users they can expand the panel to find the details" ](https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/issues/2091#issuecomment-1383157079)
- [x] [Add page navigation to the syntax cheatsheet](https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/issues/2091#issuecomment-1383144907)
- [x] [Remove additional information that is not cheatsheet like from the TLDR - examples, output](https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/issues/2091#issuecomment-1383144907)
- [x] [Add a link to the panel heading that directly links to the page where the content came from](https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/issues/2091#issuecomment-1384252685)  _(IMO, the "summary reference" should be included, if there is a case where the full reference is much longer then the link in the panel heading is sufficient to direct a user to more information)_
- [x] _Remove the x button from the panel (unlikely for this to ever be desired, and if you do happen to click it by accident a few times when printing the result looks weird)_

I second Jovyn's comments on pull quotes - I think in terms of just emphasizing particular text the box component, large + center align, or CSS styling can mostly handle the use case. But creating a component that would be displayed inline with text would be really cool - it could also be extended to images.

Given the investigation by @WillCWX , I've removed the ToInvestigate tag. 

If the errors are due to third party cookies as well as the way the embeds work, and there is no visible error to the user, I propose we close this issue for now as not a priority. If we find other issues with iframe embeds and look at moving away from them, we can reopen this issue then.

To clarify the concern behind why the PR was closed, it was regarding whether the spacing should be automatic (based on width of the icon) or able to be manually modified (as in the PR). 

I feel adding the manual modification is okay because it still has a default value, so the work to the average user is minimal - while implementing automatic spacing could lead to some sort of edge case. We could also do changes to this incrementally - merge manual spacing first, and if it makes sense to implement additional automatic spacing, that can be done in another PR afterwards.

I agree with your proposal @LamJiuFong - thanks to you and @yucheng11122017 for investigating!

I think instead of having to specify eager loading, we can have the users manually specify lazy loading if they want it. Then where we list in the documentation that lazy loading is supported, we can include that they should specify height and width manually to ensure scrolling to header works. Perhaps we can have an informational log pop up (similar to broken internal links) if this value is not specified.

(I think even when exact desired height/width is not known - like resizing the image on different sized screens - [specifying desired height and width will be enough for the browser to reserve the correct space](https://web.dev/learn/images/performance-issues?continue=https%3A%2F%2Fweb.dev%2Flearn%2Fimages%2F%23article-https%3A%2F%2Fweb.dev%2Flearn%2Fimages%2Fperformance-issues))

Did some investigating, though couldn't find the root cause yet:

VERY similar issue surfaced in the past: #569 - resolved by [this PR](https://github.com/MarkBind/vue-strap/pull/111/files#diff-96102908b73808d79ed57fa960c8f7132e705528bf49119322247c698c72f94b) in vue-strap, which removed the new lines which were being processed as a space. (Interestingly, [the PR here](https://github.com/MarkBind/vue-strap/commit/96adcfb15cc90d7ccba796ab5771267eccfdef9a#) removes the line of code in tooltip that removes the new line in front added in #569 - which I thought might be why there's an additional space in front, but not behind).  However, vue-strap was migrated into MarkBind in #1248 - though the PR doesn't seem to show the Tooltip file - and I can't seem to find this code in MarkBind.

That aside, it seems Tooltip was wholly rewritten in #1748 and later amended again in #1868 to use floating-vue. With this different implementation, maybe it is some other problem?

(FYI, the solution in https://markbind.org/userGuide/tipsAndTricks.html#unwanted-starting-space-in-links-and-triggers does not solve this issue.)

Bonus - Justified long text:
<img width="778" alt="Screenshot 2024-02-15 at 4 03 21 AM" src="https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/assets/59471320/719aeed5-4418-47c8-a561-dfa1ae2047b0">

I personally like center alignment for tooltips that are relatively short but more than a single line, but left alignment is also OK. Justified is harder to read for me though because of the inconsistent spacing.

Though I feel as a user if your tooltips are so long, this default is a little ugly either way, and I would probably switch to panels or similar.

Love the initiative! 

But reading about [all-contributors-auto-action](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/all-contributors-auto-action), it seems like its actually used to populate a backlog of contributors (all contributors newest PR). So in our usecase, it seems to imply it would add a lot of backlogged contributors? (Maybe I'm misunderstanding)

You've changed my mind - I think then the main issue that @yucheng11122017 has brought up here is that it is easy to forget that we are using the bot and that we have this on the main page, probably because we don't use it super regularly. Maybe we could make a note that contributors can ask to be added themselves (if they want). Maybe there's somewhere else we can get the nudge to express that appreciation - like an automated reminder or suggestion. 

Not sure.

Are there any downsides to using the on PR edited trigger?

I like the idea of a reminder rather than a block (the failed test at the bottom might have the side effect of getting us used to seeing a red X when merging PRs, which I don't like the idea of. seeing a red X should be not the norm for PRs that are ready to merge, or it'll stop being as good a heuristic. and having to manually run the test after ticking the box is not something i'm in favour of)

Cool suggestion, I think this makes sense if the setup code for the logger is long. Just wondering which functions you want to mock with the logger? If the mock is just warn, info, error for example, there might be an argument made for mocking them at the start of each test case instead so that the tests are totally independent and not based on outside "logic"

I feel a reminder that the issue is about to go stale is somewhat unnecessary? How about when you unassign the user, you ping them that they have been unassigned from the issue - then if they are continuing to work on the issue, they can reassign themselves and state that they plan on continuing on the issue.

How does this work with issues that have open PRs, where work and discussion is happening on the PR? I'm worried the contributor will be unassigned from the issue when they are actively working on it in a PR

Seems it was added to the wrong package lock and we missed it. See similar PR:  #1681 and look at the files changed in the PR I just made: https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/pull/2539

Locally, it runs fine - I assume because of hoisting? It also works for the MarkBind website for some reason - and most CI check passes.

https://www.jonathancreamer.com/inside-the-pain-of-monorepos-and-hoisting/ talks about some of the edge cases that can come up in a monorepo. I haven't quite worked out how this one happened where it throws a fit on some sites but not others, but its likely for a similar reason.

Very interesting! Hmm... if its now so robust even that doesn't throw an error, we can consider if we need to remove it later. But better safe than sorry. Anyway, JIC I've pushed the proper vue hydration to the 2024 master, doesn't hurt anything

hi @lesterong! the tests were disabled due to some unexpected behaviour with setTimeout being used in the tests causing CI to fail sometimes. perhaps you could test the fix locally but skip it when you commit so that we can unskip them when we solve #2238

Perhaps the vulnerabilities could be made more explicit, maybe something along the lines of `... could expose your server to the internet, which may pose security risks. ...`.

What do you think about adding some validation to the user input host address?

I believe that this could be better for UX as
- it checks the host address before building the pages (which could take some time)
- it better handles the errors that are being thrown. Currently users will be exposed to errors like `Error: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND 127.0.300.1`

I was thinking some sort of simple validation like checking if the input is an actual IP address and if any number in the address exceeds 255 could improve the user experience

Yep I think a separate issue is fine as well! I believe there is some level of error handling for when the host is being used. From my experience if I specified a used host, the nearest unused hostname will be used, which allows the user to still serve the site. I think we can discuss about what needs to be validated once the issue is opened!

> @yucheng11122017 @itsyme I researched on the difference between the null coalescing operator `??` and the OR operator `||` and found out that the main difference between them is during the handling of falsy values like 0, empty string, empty list etc. eg. ` 0 ?? 100` will return `0` but `0 || 100` will return `100`.
> 
> I was thinking if we should use the `??` operator while handling missing host and port (line 161-162) so that if the user specifically enter `0`, markbind will not default it to a specific host/port defined by us. eg. using `0 || 127.0.0.1` will set the host to be 127.0.0.1 but `0 ?? 127.0.0.1` will set the host to be 0.0.0.0 I feel like the latter is more suitable. What do you think?

I agree! My opinion is that we should use the nullish coalescing operator `??` in this case as this line should only be handling the responsibility of checking if any input is present from the user. For the other cases (e.g. 0, empty string, etc.), the responsibility should lie with the validation function instead. Wdyt @yucheng11122017 ?

Perhaps using Download Resume could be more indicative to the viewer that it is a button to download as my expected intention when clicking the button is to be brought to a page showing the resume. Another way to go about this could be to exporting the docx file to pdf to allow it to be opened in a new tab instead of forcing a download. Imo using the pdf would be my preference

I agree with @yucheng11122017 about the dev guide section, perhaps we could phrase it as "You can add pUml diagrams such as below! ..." to showcase MarkBind's features rather than the current verbosity of the example. I think the rest of the template is fine besides some minor nits like standardising some headers (e.g. X Feature -&gt; Feature X)!

I agree with @EltonGohJH on targeting only the printing aspect as that is the only situation where the user is unable to scroll and the line numbers will improve the clarity in this situation.

> Yes, when printing, should be auto-wrapped (but only if there are lines longer than the container width), and line numbers should be added. However, if wrapping is not needed for a given code block, the current printing behavior should remain (i.e., no line numbers unless already enabled by the user), right?

I tried it on the emulator and it works for me as well however I'm not sure if it working on the emulator may be a reliable indicator of it working when printing in the physical form (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26123622/print-preview-not-the-same-as-print-emulation-in-chrome) as when I downloaded to PDF (below) the highlights were still not appearing for me. To be 100% sure I can try printing a physical copy out to check if the highlights work.

My opinion is it would be cleaner to use a guard clause here. i.e. check for `html == null` instead of `html != null` and continue/return. This allows the main logic of the code to not be wrapped in the if block, making it cleaner/more readable.

Great addition to tables @Tim-Siu! 

I just have two small nits from a UI perspective.

1. Perhaps you may want to explore other options for the icon for the unordered state (currently arrow up and down) to something that depicts its function more clearly. In my opinion the current icon is resembles cursor: resize giving me an impression that I can resize/move the column.

1. I felt that the current design may be a little too distracting. Perhaps something like decreasing the opacity and upping it on hover could declutter the column headers a little. You can take some inspiration from [MUI Tables](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-table/#sorting-amp-selecting)

Great work so far!

Great point about the clearing mocks! I think that is particularly important to note as bugs that arise from not clearing mocks may be harder to spot when it happens. Great catch!

> Edit: after looking at some code on StackOverflow regarding this, it seems that they put the `jest.clearAllMocks()` method in a `beforeEach` hook instead of an `afterEach` hook. I think this makes a bit more sense in the edge case that this test suite runs after another test suite which didn't reset the mocks after the other tests were run.

Good catch! I agree with the use of `beforeEach` as I feel that this would ensure that the tests in the file are guaranteed to have cleared mocks before each test is run rather than depending on another test file to ensure that the mocks are cleared. Here's an example for clarity:

Assume test 1 and test 2 are in two separate files and are run sequentially,

In `beforeEach`:
Test 1 clear mocks -&gt; Test 1 runs -&gt; Test 2 clear mocks -&gt; Test 2 runs

In `afterEach`:
Test 1 runs -&gt; Test 1 clear mocks -&gt; Test 2 runs -&gt; Test 2 clear mocks

In the case of using `afterEach` you can see that the clearing of mocks relies on the previous test 1 to clear it, whereas in `beforeEach` if the Test 2 run fails because mocks were not cleared, it is easier to tell that the mocks are not cleared as the Test 2 file does not have the `beforeEach` teardown hook. This makes each test file responsible for the clearing of mocks for their own tests.

Do correct me if I am wrong, from my understanding this gets the last 100 pull requests and checks if the user has a merged PR within the last 100 PRs, would this mean that the comment will be sent for a user that hasn't had any merged PRs in the last 100 PRs?

@LamJiuFong I am trying to think of a more efficient solution as well but I think to check if the author has only one PR merged we would have to fetch all the PRs anyway (which is what is done in the current implementation) leading to a similar time taken

Author Usability

### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.

There is no large incentive for CS2103 users to use MarkBind over the default option

### Describe the solution you'd like

A template for CS2103 students to use for their team project would incentivise users to use MarkBind over the default option as there is something for users to start with that is catered to this specific use case.

Use the [existing template](https://github.com/damithc/ab3-markbind) already created.
User should be able to call `markbind init --template cs2103` to create this template

### Describe alternatives you've considered

Possible to generalise to a more generic documentation template. We could base it off CS2103 and name it something like Software Documentation as it may seem odd to non-NUS users which could possibly put them off using MarkBind.

> @itsyme thanks for this idea. Yes, this is an idea worth considering. One factor to consider is the cost of maintaining additional templates. Should be fine, if the benefit outweighs the cost.

Thanks for reading through the issue @damithc! I believe that if the template created is general enough the maintenance of the template should be minimal as course pages across institutions are likely to have a similar structure with only slight variation and are likely to remain rather similar over time (unless there is a radical shift in how courses are taught)

@tlylt what do you think about using AB3 as an example for the "instructions to review a PR" instead of explicitly stating that it is for CS2103? I feel that this subtler approach may be better to prevent confusion for non-NUS users in the future while still creating a way for CS2103 students to get more specific instructions.

Thanks for taking a look into this @nseah21. The date `2023-03-03` may not pass Cypress tests in your local machine but is the date that is required for the CI frontend tests to pass. The discrepancy is probably due to a time zone issue as the commit was made close to midnight. Perhaps we can create a new issue to investigate why the date varies on different machines.

Thanks for starting with the Cypress tests for this feature @nseah21. I think this file can be renamed to something like `zoomView_diffstat.cy.js`. 

Apart from checking if the diffstat has rendered, we can also check:
1. if both green and red bars are rendered for a general commit with > 0 insertions and deletions.
2. if the contribution bar is not visible for empty commits with 0 insertions/deletions.
3. if the size of the green/red bars is proportional to the insertion/deletion size. I think a naïve way to do this is to check whether the green bar length is greater or less than the red bar length depending on the contribution size.

You may have to remove the `color` attribute here to ensure all the contribution bar rows are rendered blue by default.

Hi @nseah21, your code changes look great for a first attempt at creating the GitHub style diffstat! 
However, since we prefer the contribution bar (cgit) style, let us start with that as our first/default.

The reason we prefer the cgit style is that we can reuse the same code we have for the contribution bars below each ramp chart for creating the diffstat as well.

https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/blob/3878389c8ea7891f12feeeb373c575d1003c496a/frontend/src/components/c-summary-charts.vue#L221-L242

While you can copy over the same code for the diffstat, I would suggest that we move out this contribution bars code outside of `c-summary-charts.vue` into a separate file called `c-stacked-bar-chart.vue` and generalize it to be used by both the contribution bars and the diffstat. @vvidday can give his thoughts as well.

We can discuss whether we want a toggle mode for the 2 styles in a separate PR, where we can make use of the current set of changes.

Feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions with the `c-stacked-bar-chart.vue` implementation and we will be glad to help!

**Review Status:** COMMENTED

 The new changes look great @nseah21! I agree with David's comments and have a few more to add.

Regarding your questions,
For (1), according to prof's earlier comments, I think we should consider the average contribution size across the entire report.
> 2. The same scale should be used for all commits in a report (not just one author) so that a visual comparison is possible. A 100 line commit of person A should be the same length as that of person B.

For (2), I also think the length of the diffstat should scale linearly as it's easier to comprehend for users.

---

Also, I think we should avoid the use of default red-colored bars on the summary chart contribution bars so that they are not confused with the deletions bar in the commit diffstat. I'd suggest using a shade of blue as the default for contribution bars.

@nseah21 I think this can be done in the same PR, as they have the same purpose of testing whether changes in the summary panel are reflected in the zoom panel.

Nice work on abstracting out common functionalities and the test coverage is also good.

Would it be possible to add test cases for some more functionalities?

* setting the \'granularity\' changes the zoom view
* setting the \'granularity\' again results in a different zoom view

Thanks for taking this up @nseah21 and sorry for the late review. 
I think the test cases you have added now seem pretty comprehensive. 

However, we may want to wait until issue #2016 is fixed before adding a test case for that scenario within this PR. This same issue is also apparent during the test case `'checked file types: url params should persist after change and reload'` as the `yml` option gets unchecked by itself after reload.

Thanks for taking a look into this @pratham31012002. The date `2023-03-03` may not pass Cypress tests in your local machine but is the date that is required for the CI frontend tests to pass. The discrepancy is probably due to a time zone issue as the commit was made close to midnight.

@SkyBlaise99 For any future work, I think the recommended workflow is to create PRs with `944-analyze-authorship` as the target branch instead of the `master` branch. The team may also give some preliminary feedback for each PR but we don't need a thorough code review to merge to this new branch.

Hi @jq1836, thanks for working on this. Adding a day's worth of time will definitely help in providing a more accurate representation of the commits within a zoom range compared to what we have now. 

To update the @reposense/active-reviewers-1 team, I have added some screenshots of the new behaviour of the zoom date range. In the first scenario (After), the zoom range has exactly those commits that are included within our selection. But in the second scenario (After), selecting a few commits of the day selects all of those commits plus a few more after them (which is better than no commits at all). This is not the ideal case, so please respond if you have any objections.

Let us say the latest minor version for **19** instead as I get this npm warning:
```
npm WARN EBADENGINE Unsupported engine ``{``

npm WARN EBADENGINE   current: ``{`` node: 'v21.5.0', npm: '10.2.4' ``}``

However, I think users will be able to run this with Node 20/21 also without major issues (tested with both).

> Interestingly, while TypeScript makes no distinction between the two styles, Vue (particularly in defineComponent) only accepts `Array&lt;T>` directly, while requiring something like `[] as T[]` for the other style. I would like some input from someone with more experience in Vue on this.

Thanks for your investigation regarding this! For defining arrays with the `T[]` syntax within Vue's `defineComponent`, you can try using `Array as PropType&lt;T[]>`.

However, it does seem that `Array&lt;T>` would be shorter and better for such use cases. If possible, switch to the `Array&lt;T>` syntax for all array uses within `defineComponent`. Otherwise, we can standardise to `Array as PropType&lt;T[]>`. Thanks!

Thanks for your inputs @jonasongg and @sopa301. I think this temporary fix is a reasonable solution for now as it resolves the current issue without introducing new issues. We can switch to the Vue Router HTML5 mode in the future. 

@jonasongg Since this fix is somewhat unconventional, can you add a comment in the code explaining the rationale behind the change? This will help future developers understand the context and reasoning behind this decision.

Regarding the Cypress tests, we should ideally be adding a test case for the bug fixed in this PR itself. Let us wait to see the progress of PR #2017 over the next few days and make a call over the changes needed.

Thanks for this! However, I think a transparency value of '75' may make the highlight color too dark and have little contrast with the text when there are too many full credit lines. Is it possible for you to adjust the transparency a bit based on a more common scenario of full credit and partial credit lines instead?

Thanks for this! I believe the contrast ratios you've mentioned are probably for a darker text color. But considering we use syntax highlighting with various lighter colors (line 36 below), opacity 50 (and 20 for partial) would be safer levels (pictured below). 

<img width="736" alt="Screenshot 2024-01-24 at 12 52 05 AM" src="https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/assets/68203159/404d80e4-74bb-44c5-abe8-7f62125d5b62">

However, if you've tried the highlight colors for these lighter text colors and they seem to work, then ignore my comments.

Regarding having a function to calculate the value, I do not think it is necessary if we go with a safe enough low opacity value. 

Another option we have is to make sure the colors used for highlighting are lighter colors and do not clash with the syntax highlighting colors.

Hi @sopa301, we appreciate your efforts in trying this out! While this approach does break down the huge file into smaller parts, it creates multiple files that are highly interrelated instead of multiple loosely coupled components with good separation of concerns. 

I think it is better if we do our modularization by continuing to follow the Single-File Component pattern of Vue. Let us try to extract the various smaller components within the `c-authorship.vue` to create smaller SFCs instead. For example, we could extract a `c-file.vue` for each file displayed and a `c-authorship-picker.vue` for the various dropdowns and checkboxes on top.

Hi @jonasongg, noticed a bug in the current implementation:

### Steps to reproduce
1. Merge the first and second repositories using the Merge Group icon. Let's say their names are A and B respectively.
2. Change the sort by option to something else, for example, '↑ Contribution'.

### Expected
1. A and B are still merged when the sort order is changed. 
2. The rest of the repos are not merged.

### Actual
1. Instead of A and B being the merged ones, the first and second repositories in the new order are the merged groups.

Generally, it is recommended to not have two scrolls in the same direction as "double-scrolling" causes poor UX and leads to many errors. 

The current title component integration uses double-scrolling, and I foresee many bugs in the scrolling behaviour due to this. Have mentioned one of them below:

### Steps to replicate
* Scroll to the complete bottom using the left panel
* Scroll to the top from the right panel until you can see the full title again

### Result
* The left panel does not scroll along with the right one to show the left panel's topmost contents, but the title above it is shown
* The user cannot scroll to show the top contents of the left panel unless they scroll to the bottom again until the title is not seen
* The method to scroll the full view (to show/hide the title) and the left panel is the same, so it seems like the browser randomly picks which one to scroll.

We may have to discuss with Prof @damithc regarding alternative ways to design this. I'd recommend only having the title as part of the left Summary panel, to avoid any scrolling issues.

I want to clarify a few things about your suggestion:
* If title scrolling is disabled when a panel can be scrolled, at what point of time do we enable title scrolling again?
* Since both panels don't scroll together, I'm wondering how it would be possible to scroll both of them to their top when scrolling to the top again to see the title. 

---

I would prefer the title component to be restricted to just the left Summary panel unless this does not fit in with Prof's requirements. I think this makes scrolling easier to handle and does not affect the UI design much.

1. Across the top of the screen:

Suggestion: I would make the vertical padding zero so that the title takes as little vertical space as possible. Moreover, vertical spacing can easily be formatted with Markdown as well.

Generally, the title will start with an H1 heading, which has its own default margins. Hence, extra padding may not be needed in most cases.

Hi @sopa301, thanks for working on this! I have not tested your code yet, but after skimming through the changes, I have some thoughts. 

* I think this feature would be more extensible if we allow the user to specify the markdown content needed as a config file in the RepoSense build command rather than a file within the frontend directory itself. 
* I am not fully sure if we are still looking for a simple text intro or a navbar like the CS2103T website. Would help if prof @damithc can clarify.
* If a navbar is more preferable, one approach that we could try out is to require YAML frontmatter in the markdown file provided by the user. The frontmatter obtained (for example, a list of links and the header color) using a tool like [`gray-matter`](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter) could be inserted into a template header component as props and displayed accordingly on the report.

> On the other hand, I don't think testing the markdown itself should be necessary, right?

Yes, since rendering the Markdown is handled by an external library, we don't have to test it.

Since we have to do some setup for the unit tests, we could do that in a different PR. 
We could also look into Vitest instead of Jest since it is recommended by Vue and see if it benefits us (eg. speed).

@jonasongg Thanks for tacking this issue!

> About this, I wanted to ask what the best place would be to put a constant that defines this number (maximum number of error messages displayed without showing more).

For now, I think we can define it in the view file and later move it to a dedicated Vue component.

> Regarding the design of the show more button, I wanted to also get some thoughts on what would work best for RepoSense.

Currently, the 'Show More' button takes up a lot of vertical space at the bottom of the error box. Moreover, we do not expect most users to click on 'Show More' so it can be more subtle. I think what would work better to fit in with the compact style of RepoSense is using a right-aligned button styled like a red link.

![image](https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/assets/68203159/a4d3db34-1f40-4e58-8502-2810e2b65f29)

> Lastly, with JS, the transition when clicking show more is visually a bit jarring as the new elements appear programmatically. If needed, I can investigate a way to better animate showing more through CSS, which would also eliminate the need to have a constant to define the number of error messages displayed by default (preliminarily, this would involve adding a transition to max-height).

I think the transition isn't too bad but if you're interested in implementing smoother transitions, please go ahead!

Yes, it would be great if we added a test case to test this behaviour!

However, adding repos to `summary.json` may cause other test cases to break so we try to avoid making any changes to it (the `RepoSense/cypress` branch) unless absolutely necessary.

In your case, would it be okay to show only 3 errors by default?

@jonasongg Okay, I thought the Cypress configuration had 4 errors, which is why I suggested the default of 3.

In that case, let's make changes to the `cypress` branch. You can go ahead and add more repos for analysis to the branch locally and see if all the Cypress tests pass, and fix any breaking tests.

We could add more test cases:
* if the search term does not start with the 'tag:' prefix but still has it: 'tag-1 tag:tag-2'
* if there is no 'tag:' prefix in the search term at all: 'tag-1 tag-2'
* if there are multiple tags after the prefix: 'tag: tag-1 tag-2'

These tests may be considered too much for end-to-end testing, but since we do not have unit tests currently, I think they should be added. Let me know if you think otherwise.

Thanks for taking this up @sopa301! 

Upon some research, it seems like various sources online have differing opinions on what size(s) of favicons should be used for websites. 
* While the original size we used (16x16) is considered one of the [standard sizes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/internet-explorer/ie-developer/samples/gg491740(v=vs.85)?redirectedfrom=MSDN) that should work well for most browsers, it seems like larger sizes such as the 200x200 we are using now can be [scaled down correctly](https://stackoverflow.com/a/48646940/152266610) most of the time. 
* Also, our MarkBind docs site uses the same 200x200 `favicon.ico` file as the site header. 

Considering this, and that this will increase the clarity of the favicon, I think the larger `.ico` file should be okay.

Thanks for adding the scrolling behaviour for highlighted charts! 

Scrolling the selected tab to the center of the page is a good approach when a tab needs to be highlighted. However, since this highlight feature extends from the selecting tabs feature, an unsuspecting user just switching between different charts may encounter unexpected scrolling. Hence, this approach unintentionally alters the current behaviour when simply selecting a chart to expand.

Can we modify this such that it only scrolls if the highlighted chart is not within view?

> @ckcherry23 i added a cypress test, but for some reason the test seems flaky - the scroll in the cypress window seems to randomly stop at the div before the highlighted one and sometimes it works fine. manually testing this behaviour outside of cypress, this issue seems to never occur. for now, i added some retries to the flaky test. if possible, could you help me see if this flaky behaviour can be replicated on your end? meanwhile i will continue investigating!

Hi @jonasongg, I've investigated the issue you're facing, and seems like it's a bug in our testing framework Cypress. [Using `scroll-behavior: smooth` in Cypress tests broke actionability](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3200) like `click()` and `check()` in an older version. Although there seems to have been a fix for that issue, there is probably an edge case occurring in our code that is causing the same issue. You can remove the scroll-behavior CSS and verify that your test case passes without retries, to ensure that this is the root cause of the error.

As a workaround, you can disable smooth scrolling for that particular element before starting the test, and enable it after the test is complete. You can refer to some solutions for this mentioned in [the same issue](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3200). 

It would be great if we didn't have to use retries for this test, as we would expect such a feature to work reliably. If there is no possible workaround for this, then perhaps we can disable the smooth-scrolling animation and opt for an instant scroll instead.

Thanks for the quick update @jonasongg. Can we also add some Cypress tests to make sure this functionality works? 
Also, please remember to answer prof Damith's query regarding how the current behaviour has been modified.

I think the background color used is always consistently chosen, is it not possible to check for the exact color here instead of checking for not white? 

Doing this would make the test case more robust, ensuring the merged group code is highlighted based on author's color and not all just green.

Thanks a lot @SkyBlaise99 for creating #2140 to view the diff. Frontend changes look good to me. 

I may have a few simple code quality suggestions we could tackle in another PR:
* Add a comment to line 22 in `c-segment.vue` to show that the author color is applied only when the author color exists, else it takes the default mui color value (This was not your change, but since there is a lot of highlight color logic now, this could help).
* Define a type for `lastState` in line 413 of `c-authorship.vue` that includes both the last known author's name and the last line's full credit status for easier comparison, if possible.

Can you update the docs based on your recent change? Maybe you could include the rational behind it too (the line should be _at least_ partial credit) in a Markbind tooltip.

* Default: this feature is turned ***off*** by default and the author will receive partial credit for all lines of code.

Ideally, we may want to explain how "contribution" is computed here, perhaps in a tooltip too. But if it's a complicated calculation, it's better to avoid it.

On a further note, we should add how authorship is analysed to the developer docs in another PR.

> @ckcherry23 should we note these down and put into another PR? Considering that this PR is mainly to integrate a new backend feature and there is already a lot of file changes.

In that case, let's remove the legend in this PR so that it doesn't affect dashboards that do not use authorship analysis. 

I was also thinking that we should make the default code highlight color when there is no authorship analysis to the lighter shade, which is the default color used previously, so that there isn't much change after this PR is merged.

I'm referring to the case when there is no authorship analysis. So there is no need for a relation between full and partial code attribution, as all code attribution has the same weightage.

Hi prof @damithc, is it okay if we move to a darker shade for default code highlights when authorship analysis is disabled? Do you still intend to use RepoSense where authorship analysis is disabled extensively?

Yes, we could do that. I would prefer the light color be made default (or use partial credit as default) in this PR itself, because it affects dashboards in production, even if your feature isn't used. You can ignore my comment if prof Damith thinks it's okay to have this modification temporarily due to time constraints.

Thanks for saving me time with the pics! I think you can remove the centre divider and optionally add some padding instead. Otherwise, the legend LGTM!

Edit: Seems like other CSS values are also multiples of 5, so we can continue to use such values.

Hi @SkyBlaise99, thanks for working on this significant feature!

Do you think it would be feasible to update our deployment dashboard to use the authorship analysis? It would help to test the new features but the deployment time may increase. [Can be done in a future PR]

Regarding the legend, I think you could add the 2 colors (full/partial) to indicate "Authored" or "Co-authored" above all the files and below the file type checkboxes on the Code panel. This can be done in the 2 shades of green for the default mode, and in 2 shades of grey (or hide it) when the authors are merged for a repo (since there would be too many colors). 

For the code highlight color choice, I think the full credit green used right now is a bit dark/dull. We could use a more vibrant color similar to the original color but more saturated, such as `#BFF6CF`.

These are some suggestions from your last PR review that we could apply here:
* Add a comment to line 22 in `c-segment.vue` to show that the author color is applied only when the author color exists, else it takes the default mui color value (This was not your change, but since there is a lot of highlight color logic now, this could help).
* Define a type for `lastState` in line 413 of `c-authorship.vue` that includes both the last known author's name and the last line's full credit status for easier comparison, if possible. 

Moreover, there is a feature where hovering over a highlighted code line shows the author name in a tooltip. We could consider changing the hover text from "Author: username" to "Co-author: username" when the line was only partially authored by the shown user.

> @ckcherry23 @damithc what do you think of this?

I personally think this is too wordy.

I would prefer sth like:

```
Code Highlights
( ) Authored    ( ) Co-authored
```

And for grey, it can be:
```
Code Highlights
( ) [darker shade] Authored    ( ) [lighter shade] Co-authored

```
But we'll wait for Prof @damithc's opinions on the matter.

@SkyBlaise99 Thanks for updating the legend! This is what it looks like on a standard laptop screen size. 

<img width="1200" alt="Screenshot 2024-03-29 at 2 12 24 PM" src="https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/assets/68203159/d7fa7190-db03-4e7e-956f-0952a05afa4d">

Since it spans across 2 lines, I'd prefer it using the shorter version, but we can do that in another PR.

Even if we use the longer text version, we may need some styling edits.
* There can be more spacing between the 2 legend items (>=8px), instead of a '|'.
* All the elements within the element can be center-aligned vertically (maybe use `align-items: center` within a `flex` container)

Also, the legend should only be shown if authorship analysis has been enabled.

Currently, the ramp chart slices are not rendering accurately.  This is because the logic of `getCommitPos()` was not changed for the optimise timelines feature, so all ramps from the same day are rendered at the same location, stacked on each other. 

For example, this is a ramp chart after trimming the timeline.
<img width="709" alt="Screenshot 2024-04-25 at 2 18 57 AM" src="https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/assets/68203159/b7096c87-be11-41cf-8897-94bdab68dc1c">

Moreover, I think there is slight code duplication in how the return values are calculated in this function. Maybe we can set new local `since` and `until` variables based on the scenario, but the calculation logic can be common.

Currently, using the tab zoom on an optimised/trimmed timeline doesn't work. The zoomed-in chart uses the duration of the optimised timeline min and max dates instead of the user selected zoom duration. I think removing the logic I highlighted here may help, as the `since` and `until` values passed to `openTabZoom()` already use the expected since and until values for the zoom function.

Great start @jonasongg! The optimised timelines are looking good and would definitely improve the usability of RepoSense!

While most of the changes you've made look good, there are some things left out and some design decisions to discuss too.

1. [High priority] The chart zoom feature (selected using Ctrl/Cmd + click) does not work correctly when the timelines are optimised, i.e., the dates used for the zooming in are the same as the original dates instead of the optimised dates, which is misleading to the user. 
2. [Low priority] When I open the Commits Panel for an optimised chart, the chart shown at the top of the Commits Panel is not optimised. 
3. [Discuss] When the report is grouped by repos, the various authors under the repo may have different timelines. This discrepancy may make it difficult to compare when different teammates are contributing relatively. We may want to make the timeline duration consistent across a repo group (@damithc). However, when grouping by authors, this doesn't matter. 
4. [Discuss] We may want to think of a more intuitive name for "Optimise timeline", because it is not immediately clear what this feature does to end users. I would suggest something along the lines of "Condense charts".

Awesome work @jonasongg! The ramps and the chart zoom work well now with the trim timelines feature!

However, fixing the zoom feature broke the optimization of the default ramp chart shown on the Commits Panel when "trim timelines" is enabled, sorry for the oversight. Maybe the best option is to pass the optimized timeline min/max dates conditionally along with `filterSinceDate` and `filterUntilDate` for this in lines `103` and `221` of `c-summary-charts.vue`? 

The rest of the changes look good to me. As discussed, since we need other collaborators' help for adding Cypress tests, I think we can ignore that comment and ask for our second reviewer feedback now.

Right now, the status checks are not passing because the branch protection rules require the "JDK 8" version to pass, whereas this PR changes the CI name to use "JDK 11". 

Hence, the "Branch protection rules" or "Status checks that are required" settings must be updated to reflect the new name for this PR to be merged.

This test needs to be updated as it would pass even without the bug fix. The `line-number` CSS color here is still always grey (default line number colour) but the colour shown on the report is the CSS color of`hljs-comment` (dark grey) or `hljs-number` (blue). 

Please make sure the test is changed such that it fails before the fix, and passes after it. Thanks!

Thanks for fixing this @sopa301! 

Seems like this test case takes 2 seconds to run in the CLI which is reasonable. However, I had longer wait times (~12 seconds) when running using the automated browser for some reason. The test case also caused crashes of the Cypress app sometimes, possibly due to repeatedly getting the child elements. If this causes more issues in the future, perhaps we can consider limiting how many line numbers are tested instead of checking all of them.

This LGTM for now though!

Thanks for adding the `author-config.csv` to test this. I've left a few comments about the tests.

Also, I just realised that the tags feature does not work as expected when using the `Group by None` option. Each author gets all of the tags of the repo instead of only the ones they tagged. Let's create a new issue for this.

Thanks! I took a short look during the lecture today too, and it looks clean! 

Not sure if this is possible on Markbind, but I think some of these expandable cards could be open by default? For example, the skills section, and maybe a few selected projects to emphasize the best ones.

I think the intro section ("My name is...") could be redesigned slightly if it is within the scope of this PR. For example, center the text, add a one-line intro, add call-to-action button(s) - for example, 'View Resume', or 'About Me', or the icon buttons for GitHub and LinkedIn can be added here

Just a few design suggestions, feel free to ignore

### What feature(s) would you like to see in RepoSense
On the frontend, changes in the summary panel affect the zoom panel as well (e.g., changing the granularity, and changing the selected file types affects the commits shown on the zoom panel). 

### Is the feature request related to a problem?
Other test cases, such as in #1930, rely on the correctness of this functionality between the summary and zoom panels.

### If possible, describe the solution
Minimally add the following test cases:
- Check that changing the granularity in the summary panel correctly filters the commits in the zoom panel
- Check that changing the selected file types in the summary panel correctly filters the commits in the zoom panel

### What feature(s) would you like to see in RepoSense
Allow GitHub organizations to set up RepoSense reports for their repositories.

### If possible, describe the solution
Based on Prof @damithc's suggestion, we could use the following approach:
* Create a dedicated repository for this feature. This will include code to get the latest RepoSense jar and any CI/CD actions.
* GitHub organizations that want RepoSense reports can fork this repository.
* The organization can edit a text file on the forked repository to specify the repositories that they want to analyze. 
  * We could expand this to allow more customization of organization reports later.
* The RepoSense report for the specified repositories will be deployed every day, with a report duration of the past 30 days by default.

### Additional context
We could refer to the existing [publish-RepoSense](https://github.com/reposense/publish-RepoSense) repository for this as the core functionalities are pretty similar. 

Perhaps we could just build on the same repo to allow automated deployments every day and specify a dynamic time period.

### Autosave and restore progress if the user navigates away from the feedback form

**Environment**: Production

**Description of feature/enhancement**
* Autosave progress periodically (potentially in local storage) and give users who navigated away but did not submit responses an option to restore their progress, especially for text editors. 
* Maybe restore progress by default if users never submitted any responses.

**Justification**
* If we look at features in other apps, for example, creating GitHub issues itself, one simple navigation back and forward does not lead to any data loss. 
* The issue occurred pretty frequently with me as I ended up navigating away by mistake (going back by swiping on the touchpad) multiple times and lost progress.

@jonasongg Based on the issue reported in #2164, can you investigate what went wrong and reopen a PR for this?

To the RepoSense team: 
Although the merged PR successfully implemented the required search-by-tag functionality with adequate test cases, it inadvertently broke unrelated functionality. This oversight occurred because the data seemed to be intended that way, leading to its unnoticed impact.

This is because our end-to-end tests mainly focus on testing features rather than data representation. To avoid this in the future, we could do the following:
* Data-driven testing: Add tests to check if the actual JSON data is being represented in the expected manner.
* Snapshot testing: Implement snapshot testing to ensure there are no visual regressions.

Thanks for bringing this up @jonasongg! 

I took a look at the commit history, and it appears that the code analysis is working as expected. The user Wang Chao (fzdy1914) only has those commits under his authorship as he was the one who merged the PRs. The original PRs were authored by Hsu Zhong Jun (dcshzj) as seen in https://github.com/reposense/publish-RepoSense/pull/9 and https://github.com/reposense/publish-RepoSense/pull/10. The lines shown as changed by Wang Chao are the same lines edited by Hsu Zhong Jun in his PRs. 

Hence, everything seems to be accurately reflecting the contributions from both users. Let me know if I missed something, else we can close this issue. Thanks for your attention to detail!

That might work on the production site, but may not be too ideal as it won't point to the corresponding page when deployed on different environments (e.g. localhost, or the surge preview deployments), and would also need to be changed if we change the domain in the future.

Markbind [has a feature](https://markbind.org/userGuide/formattingContents.html#intra-site-links) to get around this problem by specifying absolute paths as ```{`` baseUrl ``}``/path`. Alternatively, it might be worth looking into if you can use relative paths for pages (i.e, removing the `#` in the link).

I feel that currently, this component might be too tightly coupled with the two components that are using it (summary-charts and zoom), since it contains summary-charts specific implementation details (whether `filterBreakdown` is checked, and determining the colours for each file type) and zoom specific details (whether to show diffstat or not).

Ideally, this `stacked-bar-chart` component shouldn't have to know about these details, since its job is just to display/format the bars on screen. So for instance, it could take in something like
```typescript
bars: Bar[]

interface Bar ``{``
  width: number;
  color?: string;
  tooltipText?: string;
``}``
```
which is all the info it needs to display the bars, and it will contain just the code to parse that info into the UI component. Then, it will be up to the respective parent components to decide how to fulfill this "contract", i.e. how to get the info to pass into this component.

This way, we won't have to update this component every time there's a new component that uses it, and we keep the file-specific logic within the files itself (e.g. the different colours for each file type/`filterBreakdown` is only relevant in summary-charts, the `showDiffstat` is only used in zoom). 

Also in the future, when we add unit tests, it would be easier to test both the component (we can pass in a mocked bars array), and the parent component (we can test the function that generates the bars array) individually. With the current implementation, if there's a bug in the component, we might not know if the error came from the component itself, or the data being passed from its parent components.

Since the `c-stacked-bar-chart` component is now accepting an array of bars, I don't think it makes sense to render two different stacked-bar-chart components (one for green, one for red) - or in the case of the `checkedFileTypeContributionBars` in `c-summary-charts`, rendering different stacked-bar-charts for each file type.

Can the `getContributionBars` and `getFileTypeContributionBars` be refactored to return all the bars needed for the chart instead?

 i.e. instead of `getContributionBars` returning ```{`` red: [40], limegreen: [60, 80] ``}``` and constructing a different `stacked-bar-chart` for red and limegreen, can it instead return 
'''typescript
[
    ``{`` color: "red", width: 40 ``}``,
    ``{`` color: "limegreen", width: 60 ``}``,
    ``{`` color: "limegreen", width: 80 ``}``,

Think this is due to the `float: left` property on the contribution bars which makes the parent container have a height of 0, resulting in the elements below not being pushed down.

From searching online the solutions seem to be either using `overflow: hidden` as you've tried (but results in our tooltip being hidden), or some CSS tricks (clearfix?)

Alternatively, it might be worth trying to remove the `float: left` and find an alternative method to position the bars, so the bars will actually have the correct height. Since the bars are just divs with a `width: xx%` property, maybe putting them in a flex container with flex wrap will work?

Great job so far and thanks for taking up this issue! Definitely agree with @ckcherry23 on re-using some of the code for the contribution bar - I believe it also has some logic that will help with what Prof mentioned above (overflow & scale).

Also, as we are trying to unify the frontend to use TypeScript (#1936), it would be great if all new features/files could also be started in TypeScript.

Great job @nseah21 with the progress! This wasn't an easy issue to take up and your progress on this has been impressive. The functionality works well, I left some comments w.r.t implementation details.

Regarding your questions, I think (1) can go either way - I don't think we necessarily need to follow the average across report like in summary, since that view contains charts across the whole report but the zoom view is restricted to a repo. Not too sure about (2), the non-linear scaling might be a bit misleading visually? Would love to get more opinions on these 2 questions!

For the date tests, the functionality/requirement we're interested in testing is that changing the date in the summary view will filter the commits in zoom to only be between the start/end dates. So instead of asserting that the last commit is this specific commit, would it be better to do something like loop through the commits and asserting that their date falls between the since/until dates? 

This would also make this test not rely on the correctness of the sort.

Thanks for taking this up @germainelee02 and apologies for the late response.

I understand that the nature of these tests might make it necessary to make certain assumptions about the data in the report which might result in some hardcoding of the test actions/values. 

Would it be possible to indicate whenever there's an assumption regarding the data in the comments like [this](https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/blob/master/frontend/cypress/tests/zoomView/zoomView_rampChart.js)? Since the tests that rely on assumptions/hardcoded data might fail in the future if the test repo gets more commits, and it would be easier for future maintainers to know exactly what assumptions are being made in the tests.

Thanks for the work on this @jq1836, I think the fix of adding a day is fine - something similar is also done when calculating the positions in the ramps (https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/blob/master/frontend/src/components/c-ramp.vue#L158), and the behaviour of the zoom view showing all the commits on the day even though not all commits are visually within the drag selection is an existing behaviour and not caused by the changes in this PR, as you mentioned.

Just one minor comment about the commit message - it would be nice to include a brief elaboration on why the change is being made (e.g. what benefit will fixing this bug bring/ why the fix needs to be made), even though it might seem obvious.

Instead of enforcing that the caller must pass null as the second argument when `tframe` is not `commit`, which might not be very obvious and could potentially be missed out, do you think it would be better to separate the two scenarios into different methods instead?

Not sure if this is a safe cast since `DailyCommit` doesn't have the `insertions` and `deletions` fields. Will this break anything in the zoom view? (since if that file tries to access these properties, it will just be undefined).
Understand that this is existing behaviour and not introduced by this PR, but if there is an existing bug because of this, we should file an issue & fix that

I can't test right now, but if i'm not wrong the method is called when the granularity is set to "day" or "week" (one of the drop-downs on the top left), and you click on a ramp on the summary charts panel - it should open the zoom view for commits represented by the ramp that you clicked on. This was on MacOS though.

Sorry for the delay. Did some investigation regarding this issue, will summarize for the benefit of others/future contributors as well:

- In the current code, `DailyCommit[]` is passed in place of `Commit[]` to the zoom view, which expects `Commit[]`. `Commit` is essentially a supertype of `DailyCommit` - it contains [two additional fields, `insertions` and `deletions`](https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/blob/master/frontend/src/types/types.ts#L30).
- This means that anytime code in the zoom view (provided the zoom view is generated by this method call, which happens when a user clicks on a commit in the ramp with granularity set to day/week as outlined above & in the video), accesses these properties (`commit.insertions`/`commit.deletions`), something might break
- There are currently 2 bugs that I found with the zoom view that is generated from this action,
  - Sorting by lines of code in the zoom view doesn't work properly, since it sorts by `commit.insertions`, which would be undefined (https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/blob/master/frontend/src/views/c-zoom.vue#L191)
  - The message body of commits aren't shown, as can be seen in the video in the earlier comment. This might be a potential regression caused by #1866, as the `isOpen` property that enables the toggling of message bodies is only added to the commits in `user.commits` instead of `user.dailyCommits`. (https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/pull/1866/files#diff-5419037f2fc8c426a6a54e0614ee8033d10e16426d30573486c27e5811036869)

The fix you introduced fixes the first bug, but not the second. I'm actually not sure what the purpose of the original line `zoomUser.commits = user.dailyCommits;` is. It seems that by removing the line (and leaving `zoomUser.commits` alone), both of the above bugs don't occur. 

Given that these bugs are due to existing code and that this fix technically changes logic but doesn't fully fix the existing bugs, it's my preference that we don't introduce the new adding of insertions/deletions in this PR. IMO we can just do the original unsafe typecast (`as Commit[]`) and leave a comment warning that this typecast is unsafe, and file the current bugs as an issue to be fixed in a separate PR, since fixing those are out of the scope of migrating the file to TypeScript. I think this is just one of the instances where converting files to TypeScript help us uncover existing bugs.

The above approach is just my preference - please let me know if you have any thoughts on it (other reviewers please feel free to chime in!)

ESLint seems to be treating this as an error because the variable `event` in the type definition was not used. I think this case is a clear false positive so it should be fine to just declare an exception to this line (`eslint disable next line`)

Nice catch!

Minor thing about the commit message body: try to follow the recommended format [(more details)](https://se-education.org/guides/guidelines/PRs.html#submitting-a-pr)
```
``{``current situation``}`` -- use present tense

``{``why it needs to change``}``

``{``what is being done about it``}`` -- use imperative mood

``{``why it is done that way``}``

``{``any other relevant info``}``
```
Some parts might seem obvious/redundant especially for smaller changes, but it's good to develop the habit for future PRs. For example, the body could be:
```
Fix typo in Setting Up page

The command given in the developer guide for checking the local Node.js
version is `npm -v`, which displays the version of npm instead.

Let's replace the command with `node -v`, which correctly displays the
Node.js version.

> @vvidday Do give us your thoughts on this

> > I was wondering if we could move some code of `processFiles()` into child components so that the individual file processing that is not required by the parent `c-authorship.vue` component can be moved into `c-authorship-file.vue`. If possible (and helpful - more code explainability, [chances of better performance](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9634754/performance-of-breaking-apart-one-loop-into-two-loops)), we can look into this in a future PR.

Hmm the only thing I'm concerned regarding this is that currently the authorship component is updating the entire `AuthorshipFile[]` array into the store (`this.$store.commit('updateTabAuthorshipFiles', res);`) after processing. If the processing is done in the child components instead, we would have to be very careful about how we are updating the store and whether any changes to the store update logic would affect any other areas.

Great work on this PR @sopa301! This is a great step towards our goal of breaking down the giant components. Just have some very minor questions.

Looks like Markbind [uses highlight.js](https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/blob/master/packages/core/package.json#L45) for syntax highlighting, and it [doesn't seem to support Vue. ](https://highlightjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/supported-languages.html)

Also since we are using Pug + Vue, it probably won't be straightforward to configure syntax highlighting for our Vue files. I think we can just leave those blocks as is.

This is more of a Javascript "gotcha", but the catch block here doesn't catch any errors thrown by the promise chain. This is because the code doesn't wait for the promise to fulfill, and so the `fetch` function returns before the error is thrown asynchronously.

For example, if you try running this code:
```javascript
function f() ``{``
  return Promise.reject("Error");
``}``

try ``{``
  f()
    .then(() => ``{``
      console.log("Success");
      return 1;
    ``}``)
``}`` catch (err) ``{``
  console.log(`Error inside try catch block: $``{``err``}```);
``}``
```
You'll see that the statement inside the `catch` block never runs.

The two options we have are:
1) Using `.catch` (this makes the outer `try...catch` redundant)
```javascript
function f() ``{``
  return Promise.reject("Error");
``}``

try ``{``
  f()
    .then(() => ``{``
      console.log("Success");
      return 1;
    ``}``)
    .catch((err) => ``{``
      console.log(`This runs and catches the error: $``{``err``}```)
    ``}``)
``}`` catch (err) ``{``
  console.log(`This code still never runs: $``{``err``}```);
``}``
```

or 

2) Using `async/await`, which forces everything after await to wait for the promise to be fulfilled. So we can use the `try...catch` here:
```javascript
async function f() ``{``
  return Promise.reject("Error");
``}``

try ``{``
  await f()
  console.log("Success")
``}`` catch (err) ``{``
  console.log(`Now this runs: $``{``err``}```);
``}``
```

Thanks for your work on this @sopa301!

Just wanted to highlight some things about the usage of `v-html`: There are some pretty important security concerns we need to be mindful of when using this, since rendering HTML that's partly controlled by users has the potential to lead to XSS vulnerabilities.

Reference: [Vue's docs](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/template-syntax.html#raw-html) and [React's equivalent](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/common#dangerously-setting-the-inner-html) (React even deliberately named their property `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`)

Did some reading and it seems like it's OK in this case, as the library we're using (Markdown-it) [claims to output safe HTML as long as the raw HTML option is disabled (which it is by default)](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it/blob/master/docs/security.md). Just wanted to highlight this point to make sure we are mindful of it if we want to introduce any more advanced features like custom styling in the future.

For the tests, would it be possible to also assert that the results contain the tags that are searched for? If I understand correctly, currently the tests would pass even if the search results don't match the searched tags (but still return the correct expected number of results).

If this is not possible, it might be a good idea to add a comment about the assumptions of each test since we are hardcoding the search values (e.g. Assumption: There are exactly 2 charts that match the tag "bb v1.10".)

Thanks for your changes @supermii2! If we are going ahead with the plan of splitting up the issue into two PRs (one for typescript functions inside Vue components, and one for functions in raw `.ts` files), can I trouble you to remove the changes to `brokenLinkMixin.ts` and `store.ts` in this PR? You can include them in the PR for the raw `.ts` files.

Additionally, could you update the title of this PR and the action statement (`Let's...` part of the commit message) to reflect that this PR is only adding return types to functions within Vue components?

The linting rule(s) can be added in a separate PR too, I've made an issue to track it in the meantime: https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/issues/2156

Thanks for your work on this! I believe most of the raw `.ts` files are still lacking return types - it might be too much for one PR and I'm ok with having this PR focus on just the functions in `.vue` files! In that case, we might want to update the title of this PR to reflect that, and change "Fixes" to "Part of" to prevent this PR from closing the entire issue.

Also as Jonas mentioned, it might be worth looking into if there's an eslint rule that can help enforce the return types! I believe it's possible to only enable the rule for `.vue` files too, and we can proceed to enable it for general `.ts` files once that portion has been completed in a separate PR.

Since the non-null assertion operator is ignored during runtime, this method will throw an error if it is actually called when `this.filteredUser` is undefined.

It is true that in the current logic flow of our code, `this.filteredUser` will not be undefined (since you return early in `created()`), however there is no guarantee that this behaviour will be maintained in the future (e.g. If a developer mistakenly calls `updateFileTypes` before the return statement in `created`, or in another part of the code before `created` is run).

Hence it might be better (more type safety) to handle the undefined case explicitly instead - let me know what you think about this!

Can I check what the behaviour is like if we sort by author, and there's multiple different repositories under the same author? I haven't tested myself, but it seems that the current version will display all the tags (which may be from different repositories) at the top (author) level

Is there a need to differentiate the `update-selected-file-types-hash` and `update:selectedFileTypes` emits? I personally feel that it might be okay to remove the `update-selected-file-types-hash` emit since this component doesn't need to know about the concept of hashes at all - it can just emit `update:selectedFileTypes` whenever the selectedFileTypes is updated/changed, and let the parent component decide what to do in response to that (which might include updating the hash).

For example, in c-summary, we listen to the emit and run the `getFiltered` method, but we run it _in repsonse to the checkedFileTypes changing_, rather than in response to needing to update the selected file types hash (updating the hash is one of the things done in `getFiltered`, among others).

&lt;!--
  Before opening a new issue, please search existing issues:  https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/issues
-->

### What feature(s) would you like to see in RepoSense
&lt;!--
  Provide a clear and concise description of the feature.
-->
With https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/issues/2002 being worked on, it would be beneficial to add lint rule(s) to enforce typescript functions to have explicit return type annotations. This will ensure that future additions comply with the existing coding standard, and enforce uniformity across the codebase.

### Is the feature request related to a problem?

&lt;!--
  Provide a clear and concise description of what the problem is.
  Ex. I have an issue when [...]
-->
If this is not added, future functions might omit explicit return types, which would result in inconsistency across the frontend codebase.

### If possible, describe the solution

&lt;!--
  Here would be a good place to talk about the solution or the
  approach that can be taken.
-->
Add lint rule(s) to enforce explicit return types for functions. Example: https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/explicit-function-return-type/
We should make sure that the linter works for both raw `.ts` files and for TypeScript code inside `.vue` files. This rule should of course be added after the rule has been enforced across the existing code base (i.e. after #2002 is finished & closed).

Additionally, since this will be enforced as a rule, please also **update the style guide in the DG** to specify this rule.

### If applicable, describe alternatives you've considered

&lt;!--
  Let us know about other solutions you've tried or researched.
-->


### Additional context

&lt;!--
  Is there anything else that can be added about the proposal?
  You might want to link related issues here if you haven't already.

@sopa301 Feel free to continue working on this issue - regarding the checkboxes, I'm more in favour of just using component events as it seems the checkbox component would just be passing data with its direct parent, but I'm OK with both approaches if you prefer the Vuex approach.

@dcshzj I think the PR is about ready for a preliminary review. I'll take it out of draft.

With respect to my earlier [comment](https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/pull/1750#issuecomment-1101013020), this PR doesn't include:
- Loading indication (like a spinner or just the words 'loading..'). I'm not sure if this is really necessary but I can put it in if there's concern that there will be confusion for longer loading segments.
- Background loading of segments that aren't currently visible. I don't think this is really necessary either since there isn't very much point loading segments that will possibly never be seen.

The PR also removes the overall character threshold which has caused various other issues (https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/pull/1750#issuecomment-1101021415, https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/issues/1772#issue-1226495513)

for discussion: since the builder is so tightly coupled with `RepoConfiguration`, would it make sense for the builder to hold a `RepoConfiguration` and build directly into it? This would save us the duplicated fields and boilerplate copies that seem error-prone. 

I think the Oracle [blog post](https://blogs.oracle.com/javamagazine/post/exploring-joshua-blochs-builder-design-pattern-in-java#:~:text=Bloch's%20Builder%20pattern%20can%20be,for%20a%20missing%20language%20feature.&text=The%20Builder%20pattern%2C%20which%20is,complex%20objects%20step%20by%20step.) also criticizes this duplication - in our case it seems very unlikely that we'd need the Builder for other objects.

That's reasonable! I don't think we currently have any builder re-use (since this wouldn't have been possible with the constructors), but it seems possible that we might want to keep a builder for several `RepoConfiguration`s. It also seems like Java's `clone` is a bit of a slippery slope, so it might be unfortunately that this is the best we can do.

A small improvement might be to treat RepoConfiguration's constructor as a copy constructor:
```java
private RepoConfiguration(RepoConfiguration config) ``{``
    ...
``}``
```
so that we can at least get rid of the duplicaiton in the builder fields.

Yes, my concern was that in setting booleans for example, we might be violating downstream assumptions about what combinations of fields were previously not possible (disallowed by the constructors), but are now possible.

Unfortunately since these assumptions are mostly implicit, we can't know for sure, without tracing through the whole pipeline, so I think we can do with just the location check for now. Minimally, existing Builder invocations should still work, and if fields interfere undesirably, we can fix them incrementally.

> I am looking at implementing flags within Builder instead to track if the user has made any modifications to these names, and stop the default action (which is to process the default names for the repo and tag on extra information to it) from taking place.

You could probably do the construction of the names within the builder. Null checks are okay, my previous comment on optionals was more to set `displayName` etc to be optionals rather than using them just for the control flow. As long we make sure that the field is eventually set before the object is built, nulls seem fine to use.

> If so, I believe that this might unintentionally result in aliasing issues.

Also regarding aliasing, I realized `RepoConfiguration` instances would still share non-primitive fields which could still cause undesirable aliasing issues. We could possibly reset the RepoConfiguration instance when `build` is called, to avoid this.

Thanks for your work on this throrough proof-of-concept!

As it stands, I am still a little ambivalent about this feature, largely because it seems tricky to maintain and at the moment has no clear use cases.

What we're trying to avoid is having to rewrite the same builder on subsequent use (perhaps builders should be unapologetically single use in this sense and error on subsequent builds instead of simply resetting the instance).  However, given that this doesn't happen in a way that causes code clutter (only repeated a small number of times or in a loop), this seems much more readable and maintainable than cascading `Cloneable`.

Possibly null / immutable fields make writing `clone` not as trivial as `equals`, and requires a fair bit of testing to check. I am not sure if all this work is ultimately worth it - let me know what you think!

It seems like the git blame functions are only really being used in this function (through `getGitBlameResult` and `getGitBlameWithPreviousAuthorsResult`) which we're refactoring anyway - so I think it's fine to make this change in this PR.

I personally prefer that `GitBlameLineInfo` stores author information as something like a (name, email) tuple, so that the user isn't obliged to have a way to generate an author in order to use it. We could perhaps then overload `Author getAuthor(BiFunction&lt;String, String, Author> authorGenerator)` in `GitBlameLineInfo` as you've described.

Just an initial thought: It would be nice if exceptions were part of the Failable optional type (e.g FailableOptional&lt;LocalDateTime, DateTimeParseException>) which indicates that there exists the possibility of a throw which is still unhandled. Composing FailableOptionals with different unhandled exceptions should produce a FailableOptional with the sum type of these exceptions (this may be hard to do with Java 8/11). Handling the error, then gets rid of the exception from the type.

Inspiration for monads of this kind is from Scala Zio and effect-ts.

@asdfghjkxd I suppose this allows for a runtime check that all exceptions are handled, but doing checks like that at runtime doesn't seem like something we'd want to do. 

Exception handling checks at runtime seen a lot less useful, so given the awkwardness of having to separately pass in exceptions, may not be worth doing. Let me know if there's a use case you think will be useful.

> "Reflective" access is required to assert the type of exception thrown by any of the Throwable* interface is indeed of the correct type

1. Could you describe why the reflective access is required? Specifically, is there a situation in which it is possible for `new Fail&lt;>(throwable).getExceptionClass().isInstance(throwable)` to be false?

> there is an implicit assumption that the user knows that the type of exception stored within the instance is of the original exception type and that the flatmap should not change the exception type into something that is not a subclass of the original exception type

2. Do you mean that we aren't currently checking for this but we expect that the user maintains this discipline? I think this is not in general very realistic and in most cases would require big refactors of exceptions to make sure they can compose.  Scala ZIO has the expressivity of sum types so the handling of composed exceptions and exception handling is made much more natural. Maybe a compromise is to assert that flatMaps are done only with `CannotFailException`s, so exceptions need to be handled promptly. Java technically also has tuple types that we might be able to use to patch together exception composition, but that would get very messy quickly. What do you think?

As discussed, Java is probably not well equipped for these kinds of type gymnastics. Let's instead (of paramaterizing with exceptions) require that throwing optionals are given default handlers (that can be dynamically rebound later) as a compromise.

### What was expected to happen?
1. As per original specification in #1615, there should be 2x+3 environments where x is the number of open PRs. We have drifted from the number (quite significantly).

### Next steps
Investigate API changes / unconsidered case that caused the drift, and update CIs to fix it.

### What feature(s) would you like to see in RepoSense
&lt;!--
  Provide a clear and concise description of the feature.
-->

A large number of getter functions have optional return semantics - the return value might be null if the field is uninitialized or not applicable. The problem is often that it's hard to know if a check is necessary without having the client know about the underlying details of the initialization logic. 

https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/blob/bbb2f694a74d0dc1dea9084ad47b25bcd0bb42cb/src/main/java/reposense/model/ConfigRunConfiguration.java#L44-L67

Not all nulls necessarily bad however. In some cases like this:

https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/blob/bbb2f694a74d0dc1dea9084ad47b25bcd0bb42cb/src/main/java/reposense/model/AuthorConfiguration.java#L165-L178

the scope of the nulls are only within a function, which does not suffer from the same issue of having to reason about the presence of a value.

Java `Optionals` are a good way to deal with this pattern, by enforcing a client check when a return value may not be present. This has both the effects of minimizing programmer error and helping document the intended nature of function return values. Ideally, return values that are not `Optional` are guaranteed to be present.

While this problem is not limited to getter functions, this would be a good place to start this refactor, and consider other instances on a case-by-case basis.

@SkyBlaise99 Yes, #1801 does look like a separate issue from #1689. Task 3 in this issue on unsupported links seems fairly broad, so a fix would likely need to address both #1801 (probably unsupported unless the profile pages exist) and #1689 (definitely unsupported currently) in some fashion.

@SkyBlaise99 oh yes, apologies for the confusion (I should have specified what I was responding to).

I meant to suggest that the two issues are in fact separate with separate fixes.

I was responding to your earlier reply to this issue on part 3's warning message where issue #1689 would be relevant.

Regarding the meaning of 'unsupported' I think we can discuss if it's worth the trouble explicitly handling the Bitbucket profile links the same way we do the non GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket links

Hey @SkyBlaise99. Moving out the logging would certainly reduce the method length but will probably adversely affect code quality. Some concerns:
- Method calls to the new logger method would probably need a very large (and ever growing) number of arguments. So, maintenance unpleasantness might just get shifted from `processLine` to the new logger method.
- Logging close to where relevant variables/flags are declared tends to help with readability since related information is intuitively clumped together.
- Seems like might be a temporary fix, since with enough new csv columns, the `processLine` method length will grow back to an undesirable length anyway.

Hi prof @damithc,

- I think it makes sense to include the exact limit in the documentation. I believe I omitted it at the time to avoid having to remember to fix documentation if/when we decide to adjust the limits, but the benefits of clarity from including it in the documentation is probably greater than the cost.
- There exists an example of the file size limit column in the example [repo-config.csv](https://reposense.org/ug/repo-config.csv) in the section. Do you think this is sufficient?
- That makes sense. Perhaps something like `If file analysis is not skipped, files exceeding the file size limit will be marked as ignored and only the file name and line count will be reflected in the report.`
- I believe the + denotes an overridable column. The file size limit in `repo-config.csv` can override the one specified in the standalone config.

It might be worth discussing the possible use-cases for Builder re-use, since this would be a new feature that wasn't previously possible. A clone would have to manually build an object of same semantics so every object down the line would have to do this to allow for deep copies, which would also add significant boilerplate throughout the backend. We might discuss if this tradeoff is worth the code-quality gains.

Just one minor nitpick is that you missed out deleting a now unused variable `GIT_VERSION_INSUFFICIENT_MESSAGE`, located in `java/reposense/ConfigSystemTest.java`. Once that is cleaned up, this will be good to merge.

Consider accepting a `List<FileType>` directly in the builder and internally creating the `FileTypeManager`, for simplicity and maintainability. This way, we encapsulate `FileTypeManager` creation and make the API easier for users, keeping the builder's usage clean and hiding unnecessary complexity.
```
public RepoBuilder formats(List<FileType> formats) ``{``
    this.fileTypeManager = new FileTypeManager(formats);
    return this;
``}``
```

@asdfghjkxd Great work on this! I was really impressed that you tackled this as your first issue. I think you did a very good job refactoring it into the new builder pattern and making sure to capture all the logic carefully.

I've added some comments as minor nitpicks. Additionally, it would be good if you could address [some of these new lines that Codecov flagged](https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/pull/2078/checks?check_run_id=20923199843) as not covered by tests.

LGTM, nice job reducing the nested if blocks.

Just a minor feedback on the commit message body. The wrap is at 72 characters, so you could do it as such to reduce the number of lines:
```
The current implementation of `RepoConfigCsvParser::processLine` 
contains code that has 3 levels of indentation, making it difficult to 
read and maintain. 

With the proposed changes, the level of deep nesting has been reduced 
to 2 levels, making the code more readable and maintainable. 

Let's move to refactor and clean up the code to avoid arrowhead-style 
codes for better readability and maintainability.
```

LGTM, great job. I agree that resolving the merge conflict can be done later, especially as more changes to `CliArguments.java` are expected.

It would be great if you could address @ckcherry23 's comment for providing coverage of `OriginalityThresholdArgumentType.java` for lines 17, 20 and 23, but I think if its urgent to merge into #945, you could also do the testing there.

Regarding browser support, it might be good if we could document it somewhere that we support most mobile and desktop evergreen browsers, as they [have near full support for all ES6 features](https://compat-table.github.io/compat-table/es6/) (Mainly just looks like Internet Explorer 11 that isn't supported). Perhaps we can add this in either the User Guide Appendix: Troubleshooting or a little footnote somewhere in the Developer guide for easy reference in the future.

The current implementation of the `RepoConfigCsvParser::processLine` method exhibits nesting, in the handling of file size limit logic. This nesting reduces the code's readability and maintainability. As per the [CS2103T - Avoid Deep Nesting](https://nus-cs2103-ay1819s1.github.io/cs2103-website/se-book-adapted/chapters/codeQuality.html#avoid-deep-nesting) code quality guideline, let's refactor `processLine` avoid this arrowhead style code.

-->

I propose the implementation of the Builder pattern for complex configuration classes in RepoSense, such as [`RepoConfiguration`](https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/blob/master/src/main/java/reposense/model/RepoConfiguration.java). This pattern would enhance code readability, maintainability, and ease future modifications.


### Is the feature request related to a problem?

&gt;!--
  Provide a clear and concise description of what the problem is.
  Ex. I have an issue when [...]
-->

The current implementation of some classes, like `RepoConfiguration`, involve constructors with a large number of parameters (the largest constructor has 18 parameters) and multiple overloaded versions. This complexity makes the code difficult to understand and maintain, increasing the likelihood of errors such as mixing up order of parameters and hindering contributions from new developers.


```
    public RepoConfiguration(RepoLocation location, String branch, List<FileType> formats, List<String> ignoreGlobList,
            long fileSizeLimit, boolean isStandaloneConfigIgnored, boolean isFileSizeLimitIgnored,
            List<CommitHash> ignoreCommitList, boolean isFormatsOverriding, boolean isIgnoreGlobListOverriding,
            boolean isIgnoreCommitListOverriding, boolean isFileSizeLimitOverriding, boolean isShallowCloningPerformed,
            boolean isFindingPreviousAuthorsPerformed, boolean isIgnoredFileAnalysisSkipped,
            List<String> ignoredAuthorsList, boolean isIgnoredAuthorsListOverriding, String extraOutputFolderName) ``{``
```

### If possible, describe the solution

&gt;!--
  Here would be a good place to talk about the solution or the
  approach that can be taken.
-->

Adopting the Builder pattern for these classes will simplify object creation, enhance code clarity, and provide a flexible approach to object construction. This pattern is particularly beneficial for classes with numerous parameters and complex initialization logic.

### If applicable, describe alternatives you've considered

&gt;!--
  Let us know about other solutions you've tried or researched.
-->

Overloaded constructors or factory methods are alternatives, however in my opinion, they don't offer the same level of organization and extensibility as the Builder pattern, especially for classes with a high number of optional parameters.

While it's true that the Builder pattern is often used for building different immutable objects using the same building process, its applicability extends beyond that. In our case, the primary goal is to address the complexity arising from numerous constructor parameters and overloads. In my opinion, the Builder pattern not only streamlines the creation of objects but also enhances code readability and maintainability. It provides a clear and flexible way to construct objects, especially when the number of parameters is large and not all of them are required at once. Moreover, it supports future extensibility by allowing easy addition of new parameters without cluttering the constructor or requiring numerous overloaded constructors. Thus, even if immutability is not the primary concern, the Builder pattern can significantly improve the manageability of complex class construction in RepoSense.

### Additional context

&gt;!--
  Is there anything else that can be added about the proposal?
  You might want to link related issues here if you haven't already.
-->

In a previous PR #1942, the Builder pattern was implemented for the `CliArguments` class, following Bloch's Builder pattern as detailed in an [Oracle blog post](https://blogs.oracle.com/javamagazine/post/exploring-joshua-blochs-builder-design-pattern-in-java#:~:text=Bloch's%20Builder%20pattern%20can%20be,for%20a%20missing%20language%20feature.&text=The%20Builder%20pattern%2C%20which%20is,complex%20objects%20step%20by%20step.). This approach not only made `CliArguments` easier to extend but also resolved issues related to complex constructor initialization. This can be used as a reference on how to implement the builder pattern. Given this positive outcome, applying the Builder pattern to other complex classes within RepoSense could similarly improve the project's code quality and developer experience.

Hi @jonasongg, thanks for the quick investigation. I think your suggestion is a good way to solve it, works for me too. I think it is fine to just set an arbitrary time as this will prevent the issue from happening again as more time passes. Please do feel free to create a PR for this if you have the time to do so.

@ziqing26 The row count script will fail but since the verification scripts are using the migrated Postgresql entity to query datastore, the usage statistic script shouldn't fail even with new statistic objects.

The row count script will write that not all datastore usage statistics are migrated though

This can be but I'm standardizing all objectify query counts to be int since, the aggregation `count()` function for objectify returns an int and not long (Don't think there's a way to return long as far as I can tell, and I didn't want to cast it up either, should I?)

This PR is blocked for now as I can't figure out why the SqlEmailGeneratorTest is affecting  causing the error when component tests are run `teammates.storage.api.FeedbackResponseCommentsDbTest.tearDownLocalDatastoreHelper`

I have a feeling its because my test is `BaseTestCaseWithSqlDatabaseAccess` and I am using a data bundle that is postgres data it somehow is affecting it, will look into this after I finish work in #12712.

Initially I put the `EmailGenerator` test for the SQL email generator into `src/test/java/teammates/sqllogic/api/` to mimic the data store email generator found in `src/test/java/teammates/logic/api/MockUserProvision.java` but got a seemingly unrelated error when component testing. I also realised that the tests adjacent to the above SQL folder did not make use of `BaseTestCaseWithSqlDatabaseAccess` class which the email generator test used. 

I moved my test to `src/it/java/teammates/it/sqllogic/api/` where other tests that used `BaseTestCaseWithSqlDatabaseAccess` were found and it worked. Would this change be ok from a file structure point of view? I'm also not too sure why this fixed it, if you have any insight on this @cedricongjh

@cedricongjh It was a bug! I used the wrong JSON key for teams. Have fixed this. I've also generated a key for section, team and readNotification so that they are unique
`Course-sectionName`,  `Course-sectionName-teamName` and `NotificationId-accountEmail`

@wkurniawan07  @cedricongjh  @ziqing26  Hi all, have come up with the first draft of documentation for how liquibase will be used for your feedback. As we discussed, we've every contributor who makes a schema change will create their own changelog.

I've noticed that if we reverted back to the previous way of making a changelog per release, we can easily tag all changes with a single release tag which we can roll back later. I'm not too sure how the dev process would look? Perhaps after making a release can create a release changelog for the next release and all developers who make changes to the schema will append to that file?

@FergusMok I was thinking since this is a production thing which won't affect most developers. I will be writing the workflow for prof which the leads will hopefully add to the ops guide (if that's the appropriate place, cc @ziqing26 @cedricongjh)

@ziqing26 Yup, if both changesets have not been executed, the later one will overwrite the previous

I realised that "``{`` "Submit Response for Question " + model.questionNumber ``}``" being on a new line actually adds a single space in front of the text, wrapping this in a span and rerunning the test should fix things.

On a side note could you also move the right angle bracket for the button to the previous line
i.e ....isSubmissionDisabled">

Just checked on my end and it seems that this still adds an additional space. Its ok for you to add the opening and closing tag of the span element on the same line e.g `&lt;span>xxx&lt;/span>`

@sivayogasubramanian Would it be more appropriate for the individual question button label to be "Submit Response for Question x" instead of "Submit Responses to Question 1"? ~~I think the "For" should be capitalised to standardise capitalisation throughout the label.~~

edit: seems like the capitalisation is in line with the label for the submission button for all responses

Let me know! Thanks for the contribution :)

Yup I meant the word "for" instead of "to" and also "Response" instead of "Responses" as I think each question is a single response since it is saved per question. I'm deciding against your suggestion since instead of a user submitting all responses, they are submitting a single response.

So the final text would be "Submit Response for Question 1"

@damithc The email text "The following feedback session is still open for submissions." is for feedback reminder emails.

1. Should we change session closing email text 
"Just a gentle reminder that the following feedback session is closing soon." ->"Just a gentle reminder that the following feedback session is closing soon, in case you have not submitted yet or wish to update your submission.\&lt;p\>\&lt;mark\>No action is required if you have already submitted.\&lt;\/mark\>\&lt;\/p\>"?

3. Would you want the changes for "The following feedback session is still open for submissions." -&gt; "Just a gentle reminder that the following feedback session is still open for submissions, in case you have not submitted yet or wish to update your submission." to still be done in this PR if your intention was 1?

@tenebrius1 So every commit a dev makes locally has to pass the lint check?

@wkurniawan07 What are your thoughts on this? I get that every commit should be lint compliant but this seems like it may slow down development, especially if we squash the PRs after review. My take is that as long as it is lint compliant when we merge it, it should be ok.

@tenebrius1 I understand that the linting would only be done on the changes from the previous commit. The only problem I have which may not be agreed by everyone is that every commit you make is lint compliant, forcing developers to either fix their commits to comply (which may slow down development) or make fewer and bigger commits to get around this.

I get that the "right" thing to do would be to have every commit comply to our linting rules, but in reality I think we are more concerned about the code complying just before we merge it into the codebase.

I have roped in @wkurniawan07, a much more senior maintainer, to see what he thinks.  @zhaojj2209 @samuelfangjw @ziqing26 @fsgmhoward If you guys have any inputs as well to this

I see, so the changes you have made in DeleteInstructorAction would cause AdminAccountsPageE2ETest to fail as the there is currently 1 instructor attached to the course CS2103 (they are invisible as well, causing the test to fail too).

~Should the default case ever execute? We could throw an error here instead of returning a dummy value
Have not tried this but found `invalidPipeArgumentError` to be a possible one~

Since this is already typed, there is no way the default statement is executed unless a new feedback question type is added and the new statement is not added to the pipe. Therefore I think we should add an assert statement in the default clause which informs devs that someone had mistakenly forgot to add the new question to the file

Hi @mingyuanc, this PR looks good to me but a point on testing which you asked about

- the current test in `src/test/java/teammates/ui/webapi/InstructorSearchIndexingWorkerActionTest.java` uses the databundle for the datastore as far as I can tell so this tests that your action is still compatible with datastore, `src/it/java/teammates/it/ui/webapi/` can be used to make the corresponding action test the `isMigrated` portion of your code, so you can reference the other tests in that folder

edit: Changed what should be done for the `isMigrated` case

Is this commented because feedbackResponseComments are persisting although feedbackResponse is not updated? Perhaps you can disable the test since this test is not doing anything. Also is someone working on a fix for this?

I feel like this line causes the previous test to fail. Perhaps you can compare feedbackResponse with oldResponse instead before calling update? I think updateFeedbackResponse causes the merge to save the comments that have changed in your test

@ziqing26 @jayasting98 Yes I believe ZQ is right that this isn't needed. The migration scripts was meant to use as a one-off to migrate account requests(and other non-course entities) from Datastore to our SQL database, which should be completed next week.

I'm assuming the account request form feature will only be merged much later? So I think when the time comes you would need to create a migration SQL migration script which modifies the column values directly in the SQL database. Therefore you should not modify this script since the values don't mean anything till the ARF feature is merged

I think we can standardise the property to either not be prefixed by "app-" (like here) or prefix the property with "app-" like in your `src/main/resources/build-dev.template.properties`

On a side note would you know what "app-" is? I'm wondering if it means its a property of GAE, else we probably drop the "app" from postgres attributes since its on Cloud SQL

I see!

Also when I mentioned removing the fetch, I thought you would move the commitTransaction to the end of migrateEntity. I think this could make each migrateEntity only use one transaction (I guess this assumed that all teams can be stored in memory which I think its quite probably) Instead of two (although you wouldn't be able to use saveEntityDeferred)

Could you see if theres any performance benefit if you - move commit transaction to the end of MigrateEntity and remove the fetch section?

I'm thinking if we should instead continue to verify the rest of the chain to get all the errors before we fix them all at once. Only being able to see one error could make us repeatedly run the verification to fix one error at a time relating to this course

The [docs](https://teammates.github.io/teammates/development.html#logging-in-to-a-teammates-instance) on masquerade mode is unclear on what username is on the development server 

`When logged in as administrator, masquerade mode can also be used to impersonate instructors and students by adding user=username to the URL e.g http://localhost:8080/web/student/home?user=johnKent.`

Developers who want to use masquerade mode have to ensure that the`username`  is the email address used to verify the user e.g (person@x.com) when signing up mock instructors. Username such as jack (for google id jack@example.com) would not work as the username.

@domlimm Ok sounds good to me. I think we can put it after the login without UI, so we can group the login docs together. Then we can link the current snippet on masquerade to the new section which elaborates on how to use masquerade

As an extension to #12466, we can add steps in the [developer guide](https://teammates.github.io/teammates/development.html#logging-in-to-a-teammates-instance) to make it clearer on how we can enter masquerade mode. This discussion #12433 outlines the steps and would be helpful.


This can be a new subsection under `Logging in to a TEAMMATES instance`, after `Logging in without UI`

**Description of feature/enhancement**
Existing JSON test data used for tests is in the format for the current noSQL database. Migrating each JSON file by hand can be tedious due to the foreign key relationships enforced by SQL and any other attribute changes. This can be solved by using a user script to migrate these files instead


**Proposed Usage**
1. Specify JSON file to migrate, and create migrated file in same directory as JSON file
2. Create a folder to place JSON files to migrate and migrate all JSON files

Comments on what would be easier to use to use is welcome

From what I recall and what I've seen in this report, its all capitalisation errors for time and might be because of my computers formatting, Mac M1. As long as you make a PR and the component tests passes in the CI, you should be good to go

Would be helpful if you listed out the steps so that I can understand what you have actually done.

I assume that you are trying to access the teammates website using your browser, if so you have to follow the "Managing the dev server: front-end" as well as the "Managing the dev server: back-end" sections. Let me know if this helps and what went  wrong

The order of the commands you should have executed should have thus been

./gradlew generateTypes 
npm run build
./gradlew serverRun
docker-compose up -d

Cedric, I have improved the IT and have checked `DataBundleLogicIT.json` to ensure that there is indeed, some FeedbackSession, FeedbackQuestion, FeedbackResponse, FeedbackResponseComment and DeadlineExtension linked to the `session1InTypicalCourse` course. I can confirm that the cascading works.

To be honest, it's a little wonky. I retried and removed `@OnDelete(action = OnDeleteAction.CASCADE)` from the entity classes that I have added and only removing `@OnDelete(action = OnDeleteAction.CASCADE)` from FeedbackQuestion results in the IT passing. The ones in FeedbackSession are required. i.e.,:

![image](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/assets/46486515/a35ed19b-52b5-4888-b188-e06fad1ab93c)

For clarity ([source](https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/6.4/userguide/html_single/Hibernate_User_Guide.html#pc-cascade-remove)):

> 6.15.3. CascadeType.REMOVE
The CascadeType.REMOVE allows us to remove a child entity along with the parent one. Traditionally, Hibernate called this operation delete, that’s why the org.hibernate.annotations.CascadeType provides a DELETE cascade option. However, CascadeType.REMOVE and org.hibernate.annotations.CascadeType.DELETE are identical.

Also for reference:
`@OnDelete(action = OnDeleteAction.CASCADE)` is used to specify the `ON DELETE CASCADE` action at the database level, ensuring that the database itself enforces the cascading delete behavior.

To add on, `CriteriaDelete` has restrictions as compared to `CriteriaQuery` i.e., Joins are not supported. We need to use `Subquery` for this matter.

@athakaras @weiquu so sorry for getting back late. I will just add my comments down below.

> For the breakpoint you put it as max width 767px, but I think most styles currently use a max width of 768px... doesn't make too much of a difference, but maybe we should standardise to 768px?

Yes, let's keep it to 768px please! This from [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp) might be helpful.

> Some thoughts

Based on all that were discussed, in my opinion, the buttons should try to fill up the spaces equally and symmetrically i.e., All alignment are centered, and some spacing at the left and right WHEN the screen size gets smaller. I think it might be difficult to understand what I just said but it's exactly what @weiquu had commented above in the 1st comment. Let's try to do that wherever possible 👍🏻 

> Let's try to use Bootstrap [classes](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/buttons/) and [breakpoints](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/breakpoints/) as far as possible! Do quickly check if there's anything there that can be changed.

Always the best guideline as we're using external libraries to help us with the UI.

I believe that should be it. Thank you both! @athakaras do ping us once you're ready for a review, thanks!

@athakaras @weiquu So sorry for the late review. Just took some time to look at everything.

I noticed that when width is > 768px, the buttons (at least in instructor courses page) become awkward looking again. It's fine >= 1079px onwards. To sum up, 769-1078px does need some tweaking. Maybe we can leave it for another issue.

Another thing - is this meant to look like that? The 2 buttons do not have any spacing between them @ 767px, and when courses are archived.

All in all, LGTM! Thank you for making all the changes, well done @athakaras and @weiquu for helping all the way! Kudos to you both! 😃

@singhabhyudita Good attempt! Do consider what was suggested in the opening of the issue that you're currently fixing. As TEAMMATES uses a UI library, [Boostrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/), it is always a good rule of thumb to make use of it. Do look at the documentation for anything that you can make use of to solve the issue instead of creating custom styles that could clutter up the related files in the long run 👍🏻 

Also, please ensure that all tests are passing. E2E Tests fails from time to time, not to worry, we'll look at it and re-run if it fails.

@rexong @weiquu

> I would think that the behaviour should be the pasted text gets truncated instead.

I will stick with this, it makes more sense. If I am using this editor and my end of text gets truncated, it could give a bad user experience.

HW, let us know your thoughts. Always welcome other views! Not sure on the complexity of this implementation. But yes substring is the way to go as WQ suggested. I think we can close an eye on the performance for now as it's capped at 2KB worth of characters, performance shouldn't be impacted, is significant.

Nice work! Just a minor comment. Would like both of your thoughts @rexong @weiquu

If we copy the text (via Select All and Copy) we've already entered in the editor and paste it back, the number of characters left is back to 2000.

If we cut the text instead, everything works as expected. Not sure if it's due to TinyMCE's API/the intended behaviour.

A video for both of your reference @ x2 speed please. Sorry it's a little lengthy, was thinking what to write and also show the behaviour.

```suggestion
### Masquerading as another user

Masquerade mode is a feature that enables the admin to log in as mock instructors/students for testing and situations where masquerading as another user is applicable.

Essentially, when you are logged into the administrator account, you will be able to conveniently and directly access the other instructor/student accounts. When in masquerade mode, you should see a `(M)` at the top right of the page you are on.

**Note**:
If you decide to use port `8080` for the following steps below, make sure you have run `npm run build` in your project root. For more information, refer to [Building front-end files](#building-front-end-files). Else, you may use port `4200` which is TEAMMATES' frontend URL.

To prepare for _masquerade mode_, do the following:

- Log in as an administrator via http://localhost:4200/web/admin/home.
  - For more information, refer to the [Logging in to a TEAMMATES instance](#logging-in-to-a-teammates-instance) section above in this document.
- Create a new instructor by filling in the Name, Email, and Institution fields in the form provided. Once done, click on _Add Instructor_, followed by _Add_ under the **Action** column.
  - Copy the link address from the **_join link_**.
- Log out from the administrator account. Use the link you copied in the previous step and paste it into your browser's search bar. Enter the new account's email and register for the course.
  - Now, the registration is !!completed!! and we have a new account that we can masquerade as.
- Lastly, log out from the current account and log back in as an administrator and follow the rest of the steps below.

To masquerade as an **_instructor_**:

- Use the instructor's path `/web/instructor/home` with the instructor's email appended as a query parameter, e.g., `http://localhost:4200/web/instructor/home?user=kelvin@gmail.com`.
- For convenience, http://localhost:4200/web/instructor/home?user=INSTRUCTOR_EMAIL. Double click on `INSTRUCTOR_EMAIL` to replace it with the instructor's email.

To masquerade as a **_student_**:

- Use the student's path `/web/student/home` with the student's email appended as a query parameter, e.g., `http://localhost:4200/web/student/home?user=janethestudent@gmail.com`.
- For convenience, http://localhost:4200/web/student/home?user=STUDENT_EMAIL. Double click on `STUDENT_EMAIL` to replace it with the student's email.

Here there is a whitespace added:

Hello @rahulpro2001, do fix the lint issues as well as the failing snapshot tests before we proceed to review your work. You may update the snapshots by running `npm run test` and pressing `a` to run all test cases. After that, check through the snapshots to make sure the changes are as expected, then press `u` to update them. You can find more details on snapshot testing [here](https://teammates.github.io/teammates/snapshot-testing.html).

**Steps to reproduce**

Production/Live
1. Visit https://teammates.github.io/teammates/development.html#pre-requisites.

Locally
1. Change directory into the `docs` folder in project root i.e., `cd docs`.
2. Run `npm run serve`.
3. Visit http://127.0.0.1:8080/teammates/development.html#managing-the-dev-server-back-end.

**Expected behaviour**

Line 2 should be removed. Not sure why the line numbers are not showing locally, please disregard that.

**Actual behaviour**

</div>

%%[created at: 2023 Dec 24 11:45:34]%%

**Steps to reproduce**

1. Head to **Sessions** page.
2. On any course, click on **Copy**.
3. You should see this that the `Name for copied session*` has the same name as the Session you clicked **Copy** on. Now, clear the text input and this is what you will get below.
![image](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/assets/46486515/8284c9b1-6414-4832-95fe-28db8ff935ce)

Now, let's try to add a whitespace. Validation passes i.e., There is a value for the copied session's name and it is a whitespace.

![image](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/assets/46486515/ffe713a1-0015-43fb-844c-afe0e429e43c)

**Expected behaviour**

Whitespace should not be allowed for the copied session's name. Input validation should not allow whitespaces.

**Actual behaviour**

Converse of the above expected behaviour, i.e., Currently, whitespace as name is allowed and this happens after clicking on Copy:
![image](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/assets/46486515/ce70e78a-7869-4e7c-a093-8753a2db2476)

This is validated on the client side. However, we should validate on the form first.

**Additional info**

Motivation for this issue from a PR: https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/pull/12670#issuecomment-1868207324

Proposed Solution:
1. You may look at this link on form validation: https://www.javatpoint.com/angular-form-validation-no-whitespace-allowed
2. Refer to this file in the codebase: `src\web\app\pages-help\session-links-recovery\session-links-recovery-page.component.ts`, there is an example on how validation is done L39, and you may use the above link in Point 1 to help you too.
And this is the page (http://localhost:4200/web/front/help/session-links-recovery):
![image](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/assets/46486515/65af0787-2123-457b-9785-0267de1cb406)
To get to the above page, once you're logged in, in the navbar, click on Help -&gt; Recover Session Links -&gt; Hit on Submit without any input.

Should we also add steps to how one can use the masquerade feature? There was a recent discussion [here](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/discussions/12433#discussioncomment-5933766).

Apologies for spamming up this issue.

@NicolasCwy On second thought, let's open up another issue as a good first one. It might be rather complex for the current author of the PR to try it out and add the docs. If you're good with this, I can make the issue.

Do you reckon we should add a new sub-section between `Logging in to a TEAMMATES instance` and `Logging in without UI`?

@rexong Fair point! This lies in the UX, or maybe the relationship between a Course and Feedback Session. The suggestions that you've provided are good. We could also allow them to select the same session but if the same session already exists, perhaps we could have them make some changes for differentiation.

My understanding might not be 100% accurate on this. Let's hear what the rest thinks 👍🏻

@ziqing26 It does affect the old logic. This change removes the sending of the registration email.

In the old logic, when the account request is created by the admin, the account request is already approved (it is only pending when it is still in the Google form responses), so we send the registration email. On the other hand, in the new logic, when the account request is created by an instructor, the account request is merely pending, so we do not send the registration email.

Still, I think this is the intended change, right?

I was also thinking this. However, I felt the singular, `comment`, didn't feel exactly right either. Also, I saw `teammates.storage.sqlentity.Student` also had a similar plural `comments` attribute, despite not being a collection, but a mere string.

https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/blob/234218979f55d3eb5689186ad737dcbdd22b3df8/src/main/java/teammates/storage/sqlentity/Student.java#L15-L23

Nevertheless, I can change this, but I think we will also have to change this in the tech design doc (I see it in some places there too), if you still insist.

From my understanding, the feature branch will only be merged after the migration is completed, right? Is this no longer the case? Assuming this is still the case, the script should not be used anymore when this is merged so I was not too careful on this. This was mainly placed there to prevent compilation errors. 😅

Regardless, I did specifically choose `APPROVED` because it does in fact correspond to `registeredAt` being null. What you are describing, where `registeredAt` is non-null and an account has been created, actually corresponds to `REGISTERED`.

There was also a discussion on this in the issue. It was long ago though, so maybe you missed it. Just in case, see:
- https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/issues/11878#issuecomment-1173783073
- https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/issues/11878#issuecomment-1173803204
- https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/issues/11878#issuecomment-1173816614

Of course, there is the case where it is set to `APPROVED` when it should actually in fact be `REGISTERED`, but I felt it was not a big problem because of the assumption above, and because the account was already created so the account request could then already be ignored.

Still, I can try to change this so that it is more accurate by making it such that it is `APPROVED` if `registeredAt` is null or `REGISTERED` otherwise, instead of being default `APPROVED` always. This way, it should be correct even if migration is done after the feature branch is merged. In order for the other PR that depends on this to be submitted, let's merge this first; I will make this change to the migration script in a separate PR. I hope this is okay, @EuniceSim142

After writing the test case for when there are ongoing sessions in both Datastore and SQL, I realised that the counting of total ongoing sessions was wrong. It double counted the ongoing sessions that were simultaneously in both databases. The previous code is only correct if the ongoing sessions are in only one or (exclusive) the other.

I also added a test case for when the course is migrated but not the instructor's account.

I think we are trying to create a copy of the `Map` object instead of using the object directly, right? There is a simpler way to do it. Similarly for the `Map` for students. See below.

We can just copy the `Map` object here, then pass the copy into the `accept` method. Something like the following:

```java
if (!instructorDeadlines.containsKey(emailAddress)) ``{``
    return;
``}``
Map<String, Instant> newInstructorDeadlines = new HashMap<>(instructorDeadlines);
deadlinesUpdater.accept(newInstructorDeadlines);
updateOptionsBuilder.withInstructorDeadlines(newInstructorDeadlines);
```

Similarly for the `Map` for students.

I see. I was not aware Objectify had that cache. That makes a lot of sense now; thank you for the insight. Then I think these changes should be fine. Let's just simplify your changes according to my nits (unless you protest), and let's add the `Objectify.clear()` thing to the unit tests.

Thanks for proposing your changes @cedricongjh . Perhaps we should update the unit tests too, such that it fails with the old code, but passes with your proposed changes. If this code is the cause of the issue, I think your changes should be mostly okay, albeit with a few nits.

However, are we actually certain that this is the actual cause of the issue? It has been a while since I've worked on this project so correct me if I am wrong. I do agree that the current code updates the deadline maps in the `FeedbackSessionAttributes` object in memory. However, doesn't the `FeedbackSessionsDb::updateFeedbackSession` method load the `FeedbackSession` from the database (`FeedbackSessionsDb.java` line 207 `... getFeedbackSessionEntity ...`) before comparing (`FeedbackSessionsDb.java` line 221 onwards `boolean hasSameAttributes ...`)? Unlike the one in the memory, the one from the database should not have been updated yet at that point in time that we are checking if the attributes have changed.

In other words, I do not think we are comparing the updated feedback session with the feedback session in memory (with already updated deadline maps, which would be the same). I think we are actually comparing the updated feedback session with the feedback session in storage (with still unchanged deadline maps, which would be different). If so, I think the current code should not cause the bug, right? I think that's why the unit tests pass (`testUpdateFeedbackSessionsStudentDeadlinesWithNewEmail` and the instructor one). That is unless the unit tests are wrong, but they do not look wrong, at least to me.

If we want to do this, I think we can delete in batches (unless there's a reason why we're not doing that). I think it would be something like this:

```suggestion
        CriteriaDelete<Section> cd = cb.createCriteriaDelete(Section.class);
        Root<Section> sRoot = cd.from(Section.class);
        Join<Section, Course> sJoin = sRoot.join("course");
        cd.where(cb.equal(sJoin.get("id"), courseId));
        HibernateUtil.createMutationQuery(cd).executeUpdate();
```

We may need to add a method in `HibernateUtil` to call `Session::createMutationQuery`.

LGTM. Actually, I have some minor nits, but we can probably deal with them after the migration; they're not very important. As for the cascading, maybe we can open a separate issue to investigate it maybe after this is merged.

Is it not possible to just use `Course::getName` for `courseName`? Otherwise, this adds an extra `getCourse` call which does not seem necessary (unless I'm missing something here).

Oh yea, I think you're right. The course name is not unique. In that case, maybe we can consider using `CourseAttributes` as the key of the `linkFragmentsMap`? This can help keep your optimisation because you will still be able to avoid the call to `getCourse`.

I am not sure if we're keeping this, but if we are, we may want to call this inside `updateStudent` so that there is no duplicate code. So basically, it will be a [refactor to extract the method](https://refactoring.guru/extract-method).

@NicolasCwy If I'm not wrong, they are setting the ID so that they can get it back again within `updateStudentCascade`. To be fair, I was also initially confused about this when I last reviewed.

@marquestye I think in this case, if it's confusing, maybe we can leave a small comment explaining why this is done.

Or adjust it accordingly if it still fails unless there's really no way. The original regex does not work for me on RegExr even after un-escaping the backslashes because there is a "+" after a "*" quantifier, so I'm not sure if I got that right, or if maybe our regex is bugged, or if maybe I do not understand regex on Java.

Actually, I was thinking, maybe it's fine...? If it's possible to do SQL injection here, the SQL query would be invalid, and an error would be raised. Since no error was raised, maybe it's sufficient to show that SQL injection is not possible? So maybe what I said about the closing parenthesis is not necessary.

Actually, I wonder if it's possible that doing this is not necessary. If SQL injection were possible and it was not in that order or the number of columns remaining was wrong, then an error should be raised. If there was no error raised, either SQL injection is not possible (yay), or it was in the correct order. But even if it was in the correct order, then the following code asserts that the SQL injected query did not work. Unless you spot a flaw in this logic?

I know it's in the design doc, but after thinking about it further, even though we're getting only the pending account requests internally, I think we can just keep it as `ResourceURIs.ACCOUNT_REQUESTS`, with the URI suffix without `/pending` at the end. The REST resources are still account requests, even though they are pending.

Since the status is a property of the account request resource, I think it would conventionally be a query parameter, like in URLs with filters. (Not that I am saying you should add it as a query parameter though. The default behaviour we agreed on is to get account requests that are pending, so I think a status query parameter should be unnecessary for right now.)

>`ResourceURIs.SESSIONS_ONGOING`

I've seen this before, and while it is there, I am not sure if it's right. 😅 To me, it probably needs to be refactored and just merged into `GetFeedbackSessionsAction`, but I think this is probably out of our scope. I have a feeling this was done like this because `GetFeedbackSessionsAction` is a normal `Action` while `GetOngoingSessionsAction` is an `AdminOnlyAction`, and it was difficult to do the access control, but I don't really know.

>AND add a query param

Whether you necessitate it or not, as long as it's a query param, I think I would be supportive of it.

>e.g. `status`

Yes, if you want to add the query param, I think it can be named `status`.

>where the value can only be `pending=0`

Do you mean like `/account/requests?status=0`? Maybe the string `pending` itself would be fine, and maybe clearer, like `/account/requests?status=pending`?

Maybe we should put `"pending"` in a static class in `Const`, but I am not sure if that's weird because it would only have one value, unlike `Const.EntityType`. Another way is to just have it be a static variable in `GetAccountRequestsAction`, but I don't think this is also done in the other `Action` classes. I lean more towards the former than the latter.

No, wait. Actually, is it not possible to set the name itself as `status`, instead of `accountrequeststatus`? It's just that the variable name itself will still be `ACCOUNT_REQUEST_STATUS`, to prevent clashing with the other variable names in `ParamsNames`.

~~Yea, I think that's fine to me for now. It is strange that they are clashing though. I feel like they should be independent from the query params of other endpoints. An issue probably needs to be submitted to change this. But this is probably beyond the scope of the ARF feature, much less this PR. For now, let's just settle for this, I guess.~~

Anyway, we may want to move this to the `FieldValidator` and `ApiConst` in the back-end, and just import this from `src/web/types/form-validator.ts` (you can take a look, there are some existing examples in those files).

Maybe we can move this out into a separate file so that this one is only concerned with the component. Also, I think we usually call this `XyzRowModel`. You can take a look at the [logs table](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/blob/11b8b818f3a1e2b810de20907725561b009f9297/src/web/app/components/logs-table/logs-table-model.ts) for an example.

I'm not sure how well this would work. Let's say `request.institute` is `` `$``{``instituteAbc``}``, $``{``countryXyz``}``` ``. Suppose `instituteAbc` had commas in it, then the length after doing `split` would be more than two, so the value assigned to `[institute, country]` would be ``[`$``{``instituteAbc``}``, $``{``countryXyz``}```, '']``, so `countryXyz` would not be in the correct column. This should be similar for the case where `countryXyz` had commas in it.

For me, I feel like it's easier to just keep it as one institute column (which always contains the country), instead of splitting it into two columns, but I'm not sure what's the best option either.

I feel like what you suggested where you split at the last comma may not be too bad actually. You're right that a comma in a country's name is rare.

It seems like there is currently only one country with a comma in their name on [this list](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/official-names-of-countries), and it's in their official name, "Nation of Brunei, Abode of Peace", which I doubt anybody is likely to use for TEAMMATES. Besides, it seems as though it should be "Brunei Darussalam" instead? Also, after skimming [the list on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states), I could not even find any countries with commas in their names.

So, yea, we can probably settle with what you suggested, unless the others have anything to say about it. Just hope that no new country appears with a comma in its name, or no existing country renames itself. 😁

With this, I wonder if we can just migrate towards having an actual country column in the database. I doubt there are many cases with multiple commas to begin with, so those can be corrected manually. But anyway, this is out of the scope of this PR.

Let's clean up the commit history. Reviews may sometimes involve looking at changes made by going commit by commit in the commit history. To review a PR this way, the PR should only contain the commits relevant to the PR. However, currently, this PR is showing commits from the `arf-instructor-frontend` branch, which is not very relevant to this PR.

![image](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/assets/65202977/f34a21bd-9883-4fcf-8546-6331f62aba5b)

The following is one possible way to do this. However, you are free to do it in any other way.

```git
git rebase --committer-date-is-author-date --onto <commit SHA of "Add snapshot tests"> <commit SHA of merge>
git rebase --committer-date-is-author-date --onto account-request-form arf-instructor-frontend
```

Here is an explanation, in case you need it. Currently, the overall history, including other branches, looks like the following.

![image](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/assets/65202977/72da9752-fb9c-469d-a5f6-9b24f5826ae6)

One way to clean the history is to move all the commits from "Add snapshot tests" to "Change double quotes to single quotes" on `arf-instructor-frontend-snap` to branch off of `account-request-form` instead of `arf-instructor-frontend`. You could do this by doing a rebase like the following but the merge commit seems to mess it up.

```git
git rebase --onto account-request-form arf-instructor-frontend
```

1. We can rebase to get rid of the merge commit first by doing the following.

```git
git rebase --onto <commit SHA of "Add snapshot tests"> <commit SHA of merge>
```

2. Then you do the following, like how we originally wanted to.

```git
git rebase --onto account-request-form arf-instructor-frontend
```

By the way, the commands were stated with only the most necessary arguments. Actually, this would result in the rebased commits having a date and time of now, instead of when they were actually made. To prevent this, do the following instead for all the rebase commands.

```git
git rebase --committer-date-is-author-date --onto <branch or commit SHA of new parent commit> <branch or commit SHA of current parent commit>
```

You can cherry-pick if you want, but for me, it's less convenient because you need to go commit by commit (you don't feel it now, because there are only a few commits here, but you will feel it if there are a lot), and if I'm not wrong, to keep the original date for the commit, you need to set the date manually. Still, it's up to you.

If you want to cherry-pick, you can do the following.

1. Restart the branch from `account-request-form`.
```git
git reset --hard account-request-form
```
2. Cherry-pick each relevant commit.
```git
git cherry-pick <commit SHA of "Add snapshot tests">
```
```git
git cherry-pick <commit SHA of "Change double quotes to single quotes">
```

My concern with this is that the back-end regex and the front-end regex may go out of sync; I think it would probably be better to use the same regex in the front-end as in the back-end. Still, if the one in the back-end cannot be converted then I guess there is nothing much that we can do (that I know of).

One option would be to use your front-end regex in the back-end, but changing the one in the back-end is probably out of our scope (perhaps this can be done after `account-request-form` is merged into `master`). Another option might be to not check this in the front-end at all and just leave this for the back-end to check, but the feedback would probably take longer (requires requests to the server).

In any case, it's probably unlikely that this will go out of sync with the regex in the back-end because it seems it doesn't really change often. For me, I can accept this for now, but let's see if other reviewers want to resolve this and have ideas on how to do so.

One way to do it is by doing the following. You are free to do it in any other way though.

1. Remove the merging of `account-request-form`. There may be conflicts because something was changed in the merge commit. The main thing added in the merge was removed anyway in "Remove extra emit".
```git
git rebase --committer-date-is-author-date --onto <commit SHA of "Remove redundant statement"> <commit SHA of merge of account-request-form>
```
2. Remove the merging of `arf-instructor-frontend`. There should not be any conflicts.
```git
git rebase --committer-date-is-author-date --onto <commit SHA of "Integrate instructor request form FE with API"> <commit SHA of merge of arf-instructor-frontend>
```
3. Rebase onto `account-request-form` from "Integrate instructor request form FE with API" onwards. There should be a conflict because there was a placeholder value.
```git
git rebase --committer-date-is-author-date --onto account-request-form <commit SHA of "Rename methods to be clearer">
```
4. Double check that the changes after doing the rebase are the same as the changes before the rebase.

The ones in the test cases should also use `$``{``support.email``}``` instead. In the test cases, `EmailChecker` should replace it accordingly. You can double check this.

Just in case, don't worry over the fact that the placeholder you already have in your template `$``{``supportEmail``}``` is slightly different from the placeholder for the test cases `$``{``support.email``}```; `$``{``supportEmail``}``` seems to be the convention in the email generator so that's fine. However, the one for the test cases should be `$``{``support.email``}``` because it should be the one used by `EmailChecker`.

Are we still allowing people to create account requests no matter what (except for invalid parameters)? If so, this may need to be removed.

This is not in `master`. Did the merge do this? It does not seem necessary. There are a few other random formatting changes within this file too. Edit: I think there are even some more of them in the other files too.

I am fine with this though, if it is difficult to undo; they do not affect the functionality anyway.

The status here should be `PENDING`, but the snapshot displays `REJECTED` unless I did not see it properly. I think it is the same for the other snapshots too. From what I can see, the builders `DEFAULT_ACCOUNT_REQUEST_PENDING`, `...APPROVED`, `...REGISTERED`, `...REJECTED` are all the same builder, and they (or singular it?) all have the status `REJECTED` because that was the last value set.

If only the status (and I guess `registeredAtText` for `...REGISTERED`) is intended to be changing, maybe just have one builder, then just use the same one for everything, but set the status every time before you build?

I think this will cause the data bundle to be reset in each iteration, instead of in each batch. Maybe we should be doing this in the if statement instead? Or since you're clearing the map in the if statement, maybe we should initialise this before the for loop?

I think this message may be misleading if the exception is thrown in the if statement when it is handling a batch instead of a single account request.

It is possible for no errors to occur when adding the account requests into the map, but maybe an error may occur when calling `putSqlDocuments` due to something wrong with an account request within the batch (not necessarily the last in the batch). `putSqlDocuments` is only called on the last account request in the batch, so it will produce a message mentioning the last account request in the batch, when in fact the error may have occurred due to another account request in the batch. Maybe the printed stack trace may still somehow indicate this, or maybe no error may even occur, but just in case, maybe we should make this less misleading for tracing purposes.

I have a concern with this. I am not familiar with the rough number of account requests. If there are many of them, it may be necessary to do this with multiple SQL queries using offset and limit, like how you're batching now, just with SQL instead. Though I am not sure about this; if I'm not wrong, there are not that many account requests. Maybe another reviewer can chime in on whether this would truly be necessary.

&lt;!-- Issue title: [brief description of bug] -->

The V9 version of `verifySessionOpenExceptForModeration` checks if the session is open, but it may not be checking if the session is open given a deadline.

https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/blob/5b3a96fdde95d6ab3fef6b861c2867efe92d15f4/src/main/java/teammates/ui/webapi/BasicFeedbackSubmissionAction.java#L313-L319

Note that the code is similar to the pre-V9 version, but the difference is that `FeedbackSessionAttributes::isOpened` checks the deadline extension, while `teammates.storage.sqlentity.FeedbackSession::isOpened` does not check the deadline extension.

https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/blob/5b3a96fdde95d6ab3fef6b861c2867efe92d15f4/src/main/java/teammates/common/datatransfer/attributes/FeedbackSessionAttributes.java#L330-L333

</div>

%%[created at: 2024 Mar 15 16:17:48]%%

The Gradle task `componentTests` now depends on the two Gradle tasks `unitTests`, and `integrationTests` since #12056. These can be independent from each other, so if one fails, we should continue to execute the other (except when it fails due to the failure of a common dependency, like compilation). However, when either of them fails due to a failing test, the other one is not completed because the execution of the whole `componentTests` task is aborted.

To prevent this, we can run `componentTests` with the option `--continue`, just like the Gradle task `lint`. This probably needs to be changed in the GitHub workflows and in the documentation.

Currently, `AccountRequestsDbIT::testSqlInjectionSearchAccountRequestsInWholeSystem` does not check if the search service is active.

The following code seems to be redundant.

https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/blob/a9423daf0778ca72d0bd71e67ca1ab73e76edb7f/src/main/java/teammates/ui/webapi/CreateAccountAction.java#L114-L115

## Explanation

We obtain the account request from the database, so whatever data it has is already in the database.

https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/blob/a9423daf0778ca72d0bd71e67ca1ab73e76edb7f/src/main/java/teammates/ui/webapi/CreateAccountAction.java#L55

Specifically, the email address, and the institute we get here should be the one already in the database.

https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/blob/a9423daf0778ca72d0bd71e67ca1ab73e76edb7f/src/main/java/teammates/ui/webapi/CreateAccountAction.java#L66-L68

We call this method without having done any changes yet to the account request, the email address, and the institute.

https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/blob/a9423daf0778ca72d0bd71e67ca1ab73e76edb7f/src/main/java/teammates/ui/webapi/CreateAccountAction.java#L95

So it should not be necessary to set the email address, and the institute here. Firstly, the account request already has those values. Secondly, those values are also already in the database.

https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/blob/a9423daf0778ca72d0bd71e67ca1ab73e76edb7f/src/main/java/teammates/ui/webapi/CreateAccountAction.java#L106-L120

The only solutions I can think of are to validate before using the setters, or [evicting the object from the session cache](https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/3.5/javadocs/org/hibernate/Session.html#evict(java.lang.Object)).

Hi @ziqing26, shall we figure out how to do this check as a team tomorrow? since it likely involves including some kind of HibernateUtil to check if the SQL side already has an entity with the same ID.

Creating this super class seems like a good idea, since it has the single responsibility of representing missing responses. This allows us to not have to create FeedbackResponses which represent missing responses elsewhere.

**Description of feature/enhancement**
Use @GeneratedValue for entities instead of using UUID.randomUUID() for sql entities. 

For example, 
![image](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/assets/55353265/81b23b93-c6ab-4bfd-9a4f-6d9ac40b1dd7)
we should add a @GeneratedValue for the @Id field. 

**Justification**
&lt;!-- Explain who will benefit (instructors, students, developers, etc.) and in what way. -->
While there is a low chance of collision using UUID.randomUUID(), there is still a small chance of failure if the random UUID generated in `teammates/src/main/java/teammates/sqllogic/core/DataBundleLogic.java` `persistDataBundle` method. 
![image](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/assets/55353265/4512bf74-604a-448b-aec8-7c5967e5c8b9)

Instead, a better practice might be to use @GeneratedValue annotation to generate a safe UUID for the respective entities such as `Section`, `Student` etc. 

This would prevent a collision bug from ever occurring.

&lt;!-- Issue title: [brief description of feature/enhancement] -->

Could we explore using Terraform to manage our cloud infrastructure? 

**Description of feature/enhancement**

Automate cloud provisioning with Terraform for both staging and prod env. 

**Justification**
&lt;!-- Explain who will benefit (instructors, students, developers, etc.) and in what way. -->

- Terraform allows us to track our infrastructure as code and perform version control. 
- It also allows us to provision and de-provision infra in a single command. 
- It also ensures replicability and ease of setting up future cloud environments (infrastructure variables etc) 
- Hashicorp Vault supports managing of cloud related secrets. 
- Terraform is an all-in-one infrastructure management tool. It does not only support GCP, it supports cloud providers (AWS/Azure), observability platforms such as Grafana etc, providing a single source of truth for all infrastructure used. 
- It can also support Solr setup [Solr for AWS using terraform](https://github.com/edsonmarquezani/terraform-solr-aws)

We could perhaps improve our infra/cloud management experience using Hashicorp terraform. 

- The cons though is that there will be a learning curve to implement this. (Need to learn terraform). 

**Existing similar features and their shortcomings**
&lt;!-- Explain why existing similar features fall short of your expectation. -->
&lt;!-- This section can be skipped if there are no existing similar features. -->

- It can be hard to set up the current staging environments. Current solutions require running multiple commands to set up staging environment using the cloud GUI + gradlew google plugin combination. Leading to tougher infra setup. 
- There isn't a single source of truth for infra setup currently. 
- Lack of version control of infra

> If it is single threaded application, you mean to say, if there are multiple requests from multiple users, will it not get associated with a thread to complete the task?

Hi there, TEAMMATES does not use multi-threading in the application code in the sense that multiple threads do not perform operations on the same StringBuilder instance in parallel. Hence there is no race condition and no thread-safety is needed.

StringBuffer's thread safety also comes at a cost of slower operations compared to StringBuilder.

I agree the lack of standardization is quite strange too (I flip flopped between both a few times)

For the variable name, I've prefixed without "APP" to be more in-line with other variables for other services (E.g `EMAIL_SENDEREMAIL`, `MAILGUN_APIKEY`). The only variables with "APP" prefix seem to for truly "application" details, like `APP_FRONTEND_URL`, `APP_ADMINS`.

For the property prefix, every single property has the 'app' prefix. I believe it's a matter of standardization only, and it doesn't contribute to functionality.

Since it affects many other variables, should we handle this in a separate PR?

On second thoughts, I think automatically cascading the persist is not very performant for now. 

There are many occasions where the response is updated for other details. Manually cascading will also take advantage of the current `OPTIMIZED_SAVING_POLICY_APPLIED` we have.

In the failing test, the function only calls this line, but does not call `frcLogic.updateFeedbackResponseComment(oldResponseComment);`. So, we're expecting only the feedbackResponse to update, but not it's comments. However, in the test right now, the comments are also updated when I call `frDb.updateFeedbackResponse`. This is unintended behavior, as we did not specify the comments to cascade (https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/6.1/userguide/html_single/Hibernate_User_Guide.html#pc-cascade). 

Right now, I'm still trying to find out why the cascading automatically happens even when we did not state for the cascade to happen. Furthermore, it's an issue as I don't think we're planning for automatic cascade to be intended behavior in the future for performance reasons.

Good idea, I'll use `@Test(enabled = false)` as it'll be cleaner compared to comments. 

I'll be working on a fix for this in the future, once `SubmitFeedbackResponseAction` is migrated.

I was hoping to investigate this and get it merged with the original OPTIMIZED PR too, but we're rushing to merge `SubmitFeedbackResponseAction`'s migration as it's a large part of other E2E tests. These 2 issues do not contribute much to the behavior of the program, but more on the performance side, so we'll leave that to later to improve on.

@thikhinab 
After reading more https://stackoverflow.com/a/51336717, I realize the `hidden=""` here means that the validation error is actually not shown but rendered, which is actually the correct behavior. Not entirely sure why the previous implementation did not have it. I think sticking to hidden for now should be correct too. Thanks for looking into this 🙏

This works, but the logic is abit more complicated and will make removing of the pre-migrated code later on to be more difficult. Will it be better to decouple them and do something similar to lines 60-70? Or even better, you can do something like:

```
if (!isCourseMigrated(...)) ``{``
   // Do datastore things 
``}`` else ``{``
   // Do sql sthings
``}``
```

One problem with the patching right now is that we still have to scan through all the datastore entities, and only filter in memory. This is because filtering in datastore requires we create an index. 

Probably not needed for now since the number of entities is relatively small, and scanning datastore is relatively fast, but it may be needed next time for course entities.

I am somewhat worried about the performance of this.

We'll be making 2 queries per log entry, and it's possible that there will be many log entries even with the spam filter.

Apart from the time taken, it may incur alot of reads, making this feature quite expensive.

I think it's possible to optimize this, seeing that there's a higher probability that in an hour, the logs belong to the same feedbacksession / student

I missed this on the previous PR. In `UpdateFeedbackSessionLogsAction`, we don't use `studentEmail` and `fsName`, could we remove them here?

Great initiative, but I'm worried that failure to log is more of a problem on our part, than a user error. E.g The user can't do anything when presented with the toast. If there's an error, the backend should have already logged it

If we need the studentEmail and fsName later on for the frontend, we can also query it from the entity. This will make the email and name consistent if there are any updates to the fields between the time of logging and displaying.

@dishenggg Great job, I've tried it on staging and it looks good 👍 

@cedricongjh and I were discussing to lower the cron job from an hour to 15 minutes. 
This will help reduce the delay for instructors before they can view the logs. 
Also, it'll reduce out-of-memory errors in`getOrderedFeedbackSessionLogs` if there ever turns out to be many students accessing TEAMMATES at once.

Also, could you add a small disclaimer for instructors to the View Logs page about the 15 minute logging delay?

@dishenggg @cedricongjh I realized there's also this edge case that might be misleading (probably not as common)

1. Person submitted the responses on 12th April 
2. Query logs from 1st April to 11th April
The message will be "Not submitted responses since Mon, 01 Apr 2024 ... "

I'd rather we display something true, i.e "No access / submitted responses in the query range", or some alternatives that I can think of:

1. Have another action to query the latest logs for each student and display to show either "no submission / access", or the latest submission / access. But I also understand that it's quite close to the release and the action might take a significant amount of work, or
2. Make the end query time to current time permanently, and the current statement will always be true, or
3. Change the message to "No access / submitted responses in the query range".

What do you guys think

For performance reasons, instead of querying all the responses for a session, can we query for all the responses for a feedback question (in `migrateFeedbackQuestion`, so just get `oldResponses` directly from a query)

I'm worried about an OOM problem, because feedback responses is the highest count entity in the database (~40M), and it can get very big for even a single session

Yeah I agree this method would have a big impact on migration speed.

Perhaps an optimization we can explore is getting count of responses for session.
If above some specified threshold, we should do the slower way. If below, we can do it via this manner.

Not fully related to the PR, probably a blocker to migration. Is `questionText` in the datastore entity missed out in the SQL entity? I believe it should be the data for this box here...

Master Branch & V8.18.0 

**Steps to reproduce**

1. Login as instructor
2. Attempt to copy course, but do not select any feedback sessions to copy

**Expected behaviour**
Loading bar to progress when copying, show the correct progress, and close when it is finished. Show the successful alert when it is done.

**Actual behaviour**
As shown in the video, the bar doesn't progress at all, and doesn't close when it is done.

@damithc I realized it may be because I did not select any feedback sessions to copy, and you might have, and that'll result in the difference in behavior. This might not be a regression, as there's no changes to the code since it was implemented 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10182564/180652521-360ca29a-6a87-4dc0-bddf-6fec5b94117e.png)

For others who are interested in trying to solve the issue:

It's because the promise here is only resolved once it's done copying all the sessions. However, if there's no sessions to copy, the promise is never resolved, and the progress bar is not updated.

**230 :octicon-issue-opened:** (created issue #12758: Resolve mismatch between FeedbackSession and FeedbackSessionAttributes isClosed, isOpened, isInGracePeriod)
</div>

%%[created at: 2024 Feb 19 17:22:08]%%

Currently, there's a mismatch in behavior of the methods during the migration.
FeedbackSession only takes into account `endTime`, but the original method takes into account `graceTime`, `deadlineExtensions` and `endTime`. 

https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/blob/d6c67fc9dd31c36f196be454a22cce955e1c8229/src/main/java/teammates/storage/sqlentity/FeedbackSession.java#L454-L477

The actual behavior should instead use these methods:
https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/blob/d6c67fc9dd31c36f196be454a22cce955e1c8229/src/main/java/teammates/storage/sqlentity/FeedbackSession.java#L486-L511

**Impact of bug**
During the migration, due to similarity in names, some migrated actions are utilizing the wrong method. 

**Suggested change**
1. As the `FeedbackSessionAttributes` did not need a separate `isXXXGivenExtendedDeadline` set of methods, a suggestion is to rename them in`FeedbackSession` and make the method signatures match the set of methods in `FeedbackSessionAttributes`.
2. Implement additional unit tests if need be.

**Description of feature/enhancement**
![image](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/assets/10182564/c8e361c1-c954-4247-b98c-851b106515f4)

**Context**
When selecting students from a drop-down, there may be many students. If I know the recipient in advance, I would like to quickly type the name from the options and get the selection.

**Problem**
Currently, the code-base supports for searching only if I type the start of the name. 
The problem is when I'm trying to search for a surname, or for example in the screenshot, their first names are prefixed with the section / team names. This makes the search essentially useless.

Being able to search with some sort of substring of the name (all possible substrings, or substrings separated by spaces) will help improve the submission user experience.

Perhaps the default value (e.g 10%) can be built into the component too, so that all the progress bars can benefit

e.g for the edit course progress bar. May be clearer that it's a progress bar with it's title, but still confusing if it stays at 0% for a brief period

> Actually, I was thinking, maybe it's fine...? If it's possible to do SQL injection here, the SQL query would be invalid, and an error would be raised. Since no error was raised, maybe it's sufficient to show that SQL injection is not possible? So maybe what I said about the closing parenthesis is not necessary.

> just a side note, wondering if its possible to create tests that test the combination of the search results from sql and datastore?

Might be possible, but we'll need to manually register the search manager for one of them, since the current BaseTest classes are specific to sql or datastore. As you mentioned, probably better to just test with E2E, unless there's an issue with that, then we can fall back to the manual register

Thanks @LarsGielen for the changes! Upon further reflection, I've 2 points that I think are worth discussing:

1. I'm not sure if the warning message is needed. Perhaps a simple "Note:" under "Tips:" would suffice, or we can also follow how the course copy modal does it, which is to put the number of characters left below the input field:
<img width="496" alt="Screenshot 2023-06-01 at 3 42 40 PM" src="https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/assets/48304907/c41bf249-4d48-4b93-81f1-38e345ba8dbc">

2. I think a limit of 6000 characters might be too long. For example, names of students are restricted to 100 characters and team/section names are restricted to 60 characters, so it makes sense to have a limit around that range. I would suggest just setting it at 100 characters.

Do let me know what you think, and other contributors feel free to weigh in as well (:

Thanks @LarsGielen for the quick changes. Just one last comment on a corner case:

When the user enters 100 characters, they are technically still within the limit (0 characters left), but the search button is disabled. I would suggest either:
- Setting the search button to be disabled when the character count is above the limit (i.e. > 100 characters)
- Removing the disabling of the search button, and introducing an additional check that results in an error message if the character limit is breached

The first option feels cleaner to me since we are, in a sense, "intercepting" input that we know is invalid. The second option is similar to how course copying handles inputs above the character limit.

> Hi @weiquu , since no more characters can be put in the search field than the character limit the button will never be disabled, so I took out the disabling of the button altogether.

Note that technically it's still possible (I think) to trigger the error if the user intentionally uses developer tools to remove the max length of the input field. Quick example of what I mean:
<img width="1143" alt="Screenshot 2023-06-04 at 3 25 00 AM" src="https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/assets/48304907/d0ceae53-e7a0-43be-b813-b6fa308c4d76">

Having said that, I think there's no need to address this issue since:
- The user has to intentionally go out of their way to replicate it
- Doing the above doesn't pose a threat to system stability or security, doesn't inconvenience (normal) users, and doesn't affect our DB

Just for you to take note of in the future (: I'll review the changes tmr

Do you think we could remove this `font-size`? I toggled it on and off and couldn't tell the difference; prefer keeping to the `0.875rem` defined since there's some [accessibility-related concerns](https://austingil.com/px-or-rem-in-css/).

Placing a few comments together:
- If the above comment on the height of the button makes sense, let's remove both the `height`s here as well
- Do delete the commented line if it's not needed!
- Let's rename `.custom-buttons` as `.custom-button-active` and `.custom-buttons2` as `.custom-button-archived`. I think that'll be a bit more descriptive (don't forget to make the corresponding changes in the `.html` file)

Was thinking if we could follow the same format as the buttons in the instructor pages:
- Set the styles to apply to a `max-width` of `768px`
- Remove the `height` if not necessary
- Change the name to `.custom-button` or something more descriptive if possible (with corresponding change in the `.html` file)

The above change also allows us to remove the misalignment by adding `margin-right: 0;` for mobile screens

@domlimm I believe it's from `styles.scss` where it was set with:
```
:root ``{``
  --btn-margin: 5px;
``}``

Hi @athakaras, some preliminary comments for each page below. Do voice out any disagreements or suggestions! I think this issue allows for a fairly wide range of potential solutions.

**Instructor courses page**
In some screen sizes, the buttons get pushed to different rows despite having enough space to fit into a single row. This leaves quite a bit of space by the sides (see below, at 1123px width). Perhaps we could have the button size be set to fill the row, subject to a minimum size? I'm not too sure about this, other opinions would be very welcome.

Also noted that there appears to be some slight misalignment between the upper and lower buttons.


**Instructor student page**
Let's add a margin between lines whenever it appears (below example at 777px width):
<img width="97" alt="Screenshot 2023-06-07 at 5 06 47 PM" src="https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/assets/48304907/dcafc694-5bf5-4c85-adaa-909fd2a43c5c">

Note that the above suggestion of setting the button size to fill the row (with a min size enforced) would enable standardisation of button sizes here (e.g. Delete button).


**Student home page**
Not sure why my page looks like this (desktop view):
<img width="260" alt="Screenshot 2023-06-07 at 5 06 04 PM" src="https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/assets/48304907/318840de-0e0e-49da-80f0-75712ab403c4">

Could you help to take a look?

Edit: one last thing, I noted some styles added here and there. Let's try to use Bootstrap [classes](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/buttons/) and [breakpoints](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/breakpoints/) as far as possible! Do quickly check if there's anything there that can be changed.

Hi @athakaras, thanks for looking into the issues!

**Instructor courses page**
Unfortunately I won't be able to take a look at this until Friday/the weekend, so I'm not too sure what's causing the misalignment. My guess is that it's due to some extra whitespace, or some added left/right margin to the button. If you can't figure it out then no worries for now!

**Instructor student page**
Thanks for pointing out! It seems that this lack of margin between rows issue is present in quite a few other areas. Since it's not directly related to this PR, we can leave it to another time

**Student home page**
You'll have to go to the instructor pages and either extend the session time to a later date (i.e. later than today), or create a new session. If you're creating a new session, you'll have to go back to the student pages and submit your answers for that session, after which the edit submission button should appear. Do let me know if this doesn't work!

**Bootstrap and breakpoints**
Noted! I think the styles added in are fine, so let's keep it that way for now. For the breakpoint you put it as max width 767px, but I think most styles currently use a max width of 768px... doesn't make too much of a difference, but maybe we should standardise to 768px? @domlimm lmk what you think of this and the rest of the stuff above (:

Thanks @athakaras, could you provide a screenshot of the issue with the Delete buttons? But in any case, I think we can leave that to a future PR; let's try to set the groundwork first with this one.

For the student home button misalignment, seems that the issue is caused by the `.btn-margin-right` class, but we can't remove that also, else the buttons will be too close together when they're on a single line. Can't really think of any solutions now since the buttons don't seem to revert to a single line at any particular breakpoint... @domlimm any suggestions? If not, we can also raise it as a separate issue since I'm sure it'll come up when fixing other buttons for mobile screens.

Anyway, I believe nothing else needed on your end for now! Do give us a few days to do the review proper (:

> I noticed that when width is > 768px, the buttons (at least in instructor courses page) become awkward looking again. It's fine >= 1079px onwards. To sum up, 769-1078px does need some tweaking. Maybe we can leave it for another issue.

I think let's leave the various spacing problems to another issue... we'll keep this PR as more of a groundwork towards making buttons easier to use on small screens.

Hi @athakaras, looks good so far, but do take a look at the failing tests and then we'll take a more detailed look at the code (although I don't foresee any issues).

Couple more comments:

The misalignment issue in the **instructor courses page** seems to be caused by lines 87-89 in the `instructor-courses-page.component.scss`:
```
.actions-cell button:not(.dropdown-item) ``{``
  margin-left: var(--btn-margin);
``}``
```
A possible solution is to just apply it to non-mobile screens. A quick search shows that most `.scss` files use `min-width: 768px` along with `max-width: 768px`... which I believe runs into the odd issue when the screen width is exactly 768px. Haven't really investigated this, but if it is indeed a problem, we can leave it to another issue/PR. In summary, feel free to use `min-width: 768px` for the above for now (:

On the same page, the buttons for the Archived courses and Deleted courses tables also face a similar issue. It would be good to fix those as well.

Last thing: shall we centre-align the buttons in the **student home page**? I think they weren't centre-aligned previously... not too sure if there was a reason for that.

Hi @sxw022020, did you try using the `sortable-table` component? I believe it can be used to implement sorting based on `startDate` and `endDate`, though I'm not too sure about the other 2 options.

Do let me know if you tried it, and if you did, what issues you faced. This info will have some bearing on issue #12329, since we should aim to form sortable tables use the same `sortable-table` component.

Thanks @singhabhyudita, sorry for missing that out. Shall we shift the relevant padding change into the `.scss` file since Bootstrap doesn't have the `0.75rem`? I'm looking at something like this:

```
@media (max-width: 576px) ``{``
  // prevent overflow for small screen sizes
  #btn-new-question, #btn-copy-question ``{``
    padding-left: .5rem;
    padding-right: .5rem;
  ``}``
``}``
```

Of course, do let me know if you have a better solution

Perhaps my previous comment was unclear - we're trying to solve overflow (for screen widths >= 360px) while ensuring that styles remain consistent throughout the website as much as possible.

The code block I copied above prevents overflow for smaller screen sizes by setting the `padding-left` and `padding-right` to `.5rem` for screen widths <= 576px. Since this styling is only applied for those screen widths, it also maintains consistency by having the button padding revert back to its original padding.

In contrast, `px-2 px-sm-3` doesn't maintain consistency for larger screen widths since the padding is set to `1 rem` instead of the standard `.75rem`. You can check that this is the case by comparing the buttons to the "Preview as" buttons in the instructor edit session page.

In terms of the clarity of code, I think that adding the extra styling is fine since it's fairly straightforward to see what's going on. Maybe placing it within a class and then applying that to the button would make it clearer, something like:
```
@media (max-width: 576px) ``{``
  // prevent overflow for small screen sizes
  .btn-small-padding ``{``
    padding-left: .5rem;
    padding-right: .5rem;
  ``}``
``}``
```
and then `<button id="btn-copy-question" class="btn btn-primary btn-small-padding"`

Let me know if you disagree. Also taking this chance to ping @domlimm for thoughts and review

Hi @singhabhyudita, do take a look at the failing tests before we proceed to review your changes.

In addition, I believe the results in the screenshot don't address the issue raised, which is the overflowing of buttons into the next line. That is to say, the solution should be to have the buttons be on the same line regardless of screen width (either by reducing the padding between components at smaller screen widths or other means).

Hi @singhabhyudita, you can read more about snapshot testing [here](https://teammates.github.io/teammates/snapshot-testing.html). You can update the snapshots by running `npm run test` and pressing `a` to run all test cases. After that, check through the snapshots to make sure the changes are as expected, then press `u` to update them.

Please note that as per our [mobile-friendliness best practices](https://teammates.github.io/teammates/best-practices/mobile-friendliness.html), the minimum screen width we support is 360px.

The idea for the solution is fine; do let me know when your PR is ready for review.

Hi @igorpenhaa, ignoring the failing lint tests, I don't think this PR actually addresses the issue raised in #8557 

The issue is that there are tests which fail if the system locale is set to a locale that uses different date/decimal formats. I set my system locale to Germany and ran `./gradlew componentTests` which resulted in this failed test:
<img width="1198" alt="Screenshot 2023-06-18 at 22 04 32" src="https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/assets/48304907/7844b60c-2216-46eb-879a-e78e3bb2b956">

In contrast, all tests passed when I reset my system locale back to Singapore.

Your PR seems to be adding tests to the `TimeHelper` util, but I don't think it actually increases the code coverage. Do let me know if I have misunderstood.

Looks good so far! 2 quick points:

<img width="272" alt="Screenshot 2023-06-28 at 2 36 32 AM" src="https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/assets/48304907/30036adf-bcb4-4e04-ba5a-9dea5a0f8639">

Do you think it'll be possible to have the buttons be the same number of lines for all screen sizes? Seems to be present in a few different screen sizes (above is feedback sessions edit at 579px, below is instructor help page at 1225px). Off the top of my head, could set width for both to be the same / slightly bigger than what it currently is? But no worries if the solution is too complicated, looks to be a small issue

Second is that the button size doesn't work if there are no students that the session can be previewed as... seems to be because the styling is on the `<a>` tag, but that is only present if there are students to preview. Example below:

Hi @Zxun2, instructor feedback sessions results and edit sessions page looks good now! For the instructor help page I noticed 2 issues:

From screen widths 576px to 584px, the "Preview as student" button takes up 2 lines (vs 1 line for "Preview as instructor"). Again, this is a small issue so no worries if the fix is too complicated - just thought I'd point it out.

From screen widths 992px to 1278px, the "Preview as instructor" button overflows to the next line... probably because the preview session panel is placed inside the example box for the instructor help page, meaning the width it has to use is smaller.
<img width="389" alt="Screenshot 2023-06-29 at 4 13 51 PM" src="https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/assets/48304907/76bff515-6cbe-49b5-8b33-2ac79831460f">

Hi @Zxun2, looks great (: Can I just check 1 small thing:
- On initial page load, only the feedback sessions for the first 3 courses are loaded (lines 118-121 of `student-home-page.component.ts`)
- When any of the sort buttons are clicked, the feedback sessions for all courses are loaded (lines 309-312 of `student-home-page.component.ts`)
- E.g. if I reload the page and expand the tabs, the sessions need to be loaded. If I reload the page, click the "Course ID" button and then expand the tabs, the sessions do not need to be loaded (they are loaded upon clicking the button)

Wondering if I've understood this correctly (seems to be the behaviour I saw as well), and if so, whether this difference was intentional

Anyway, didn't spot any other issues so all's good!

Hi @Zxun2, quickly jumping in for @cedricongjh here since I had the same thought (: The `InstructorSessionEditPageComponent` extends `InstructorSessionBasePageComponent` and the `InstructorSessionsPageComponent` extends `InstructorSessionModalPageComponent` which also extends `InstructorSessionBasePageComponent`. Hence, we can just place this method in the base class, so that both components inherit the method. This way, we will avoid the code duplication.

Worth noting that the `InstructorSessionBasePageComponent` already has several methods that are used in other child components, so we are just following the same design principle. Hope this helps!

You're missing the case where:
- startDate is same as endDate
- startTime.hour is same as endTime.hour
- startTime.minute is greater than endTime.minute

This case only occurs when startTime is 23:59 and endTime is 23:00. Here's a quick test:
- Set submission opening time to 5 Jul 2024, 23:59
- Set submission closing time to 6 Jul 2024, 23:00
- Change submission opening date to 6 Jul 2024
- The submission closing time should change to 23:59, but it remains as 23:00 (see screenshot)

Hi @Zxun2, I'm unable to save a session if I set the start date to be 12 months later... can you take a look? This occurs both when creating a new session and editing a session:

> Add safety net in cases where start date is later than the end date. In which case, the end date automatically defaults to the current start date.

Not sure if you want to include time in it as well, or if you think it's not needed:

Hi @domoberzin, just 2 comments:

1. The fix has also changed the buttons for the Edit Course Details page, rendering them inconsistent (see example below - they are on a new line now, rather than being on the same line like Instructor 1). I would suggest applying the styles only when the course edit form is in add mode.
<img width="335" alt="Screenshot 2023-07-03 at 9 01 01 PM" src="https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/assets/48304907/9584d3c9-90bc-4377-8c40-f4dbcc93f61f">


2. Let's change the breakpoint to 576px, similar to how the buttons work in the Edit Feedback Session page. I think the current breakpoint leaves a bit too much space. You might want to take a look at the question-edit-form component.

Seems that removing this line has caused some complications with the other components using the `sortable-table`:
<img width="1200" alt="Screenshot 2023-07-23 at 12 48 12 AM" src="https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/assets/48304907/54cbd748-1e14-45e5-ba31-5e37ac841f5e">

Think it affects most of the question statistics components... so either
- Add the `margin-bottom-20px` back in, and handle it separately in the instructor home and sessions pages
- Make it another customisable part of the `sortable-table` component...
- Add the margins back in each of the other question statistics components (and remove the now redundant styling from the `sortable-table.component.scss` file)

Not too sure which is the best approach, though I think the last one is easiest and it also makes sense that the margin after the table is left to each component to handle.

Hi @Zxun2, can I clarify that of the 10 components mentioned in the original issue, this PR address the 4th one, i.e. sessions table?

Also noted that there were some changes to the `sortable-table` component - am I correct in saying that the changes are necessary for the refactoring of the sessions table since the heading stylings are different?

Thanks @Zxun2! Do take note of the following:
- Try not to combine fixes for multiple issues in 1 PR, unless they are tightly related (see [here](https://teammates.github.io/teammates/process.html#step-2-start-clean-from-a-new-branch)). You can make a separate PR for the E2E EdgeBrowser setup
- As mentioned further down in the same page (point 3 [here](https://teammates.github.io/teammates/process.html#step-4-submit-a-pr)), do ensure that "no unrelated changes are introduced in the branch. This includes unnecessary formatting changes." These are mainly in the `.html` files, but there are a few instances in the `.ts` files as well. These changes make it difficult to review an already large PR, since we have to determine which are merely formatting changes and which are not. Not sure if it's possible to reverse these changes, given that the code readability is also not necessarily increased (e.g. an element now takes up more lines than it usually does)
- Do make the title a bit more descriptive, e.g. "Refactoring of sortable tables - sessions table". I'll also update the issue description to use a checklist

(Have requested for a couple more reviewers than usual given the size of the PR and how it will probably influence the rest of the refactorings)

Hi @Zxun2, can I check the rationale for changing the default sort behaviour for the Instructor Home Page to session name ascending? I would have thought sorting by session end date descending would be more useful (e.g. for courses with many sessions, I want to see sessions that are ongoing / coming up over sessions where the end date has passed)

Also noted for the instructor sessions page, the default behaviour was changed from descending to ascending - think this is fine!

Overall, everything looks great (: Currently working through the code itself - will update in a bit

Edit: I also noticed some changes to `contribution-question-statistics.component.ts` - are those changes relevant to the PR? Was a bit surprised to notice the file there

Edit 2: Have looked through the rest of the code, looks good! Will go through 1 more time over the weekend to double check

Hi @rexong, would it be possible to change it from a word limit to a character limit? Sorry for not pointing this out earlier on the original issue!

The reasoning is:
- The word limit might not prevent the bloating of DB storage since users can enter characters without spaces, and that will still be considered as a single word
- As far as I'm aware, other components use a character limit and not a word limit, so keeping to a character limit would ensure consistency

My apologies again for not flagging this out sooner!

I've also tested out your current solution, and I was able to save a response of over 500 words long... the screenshot below is after saving and refreshing the page:
<img width="1234" alt="Screenshot 2023-07-10 at 8 32 29 PM" src="https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/assets/48304907/3ca65eb3-fbb5-44b2-bd94-2707c8c1671c">

As a final comment, do make the changes only to the "Instructions" field in creating and editing a session, as mentioned in the issue. Setting the limit to every single text editor raises several other issues that we probably want to avoid. For example, an instructor might want to set the recommended word count for a question to be 1000 words. However, then students would be unable to hit that recommended word count.

Do let me know if you have any questions about the above.

<img width="1021" alt="Screenshot 2023-07-23 at 5 28 44 PM" src="https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/assets/48304907/5d795c49-8af7-438b-83ea-843195c15bb2">

After pasting the highlighted text at the end, this is the result (notice the line breaks are gone, and the count still shows characters left):
<img width="984" alt="Screenshot 2023-07-23 at 5 28 54 PM" src="https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/assets/48304907/b9e00ef3-bdff-46f0-b19b-b715d5428590">

I believe it should be an issue with the `editor.setContent(limitContent);` line, though I'm not very certain.

Also noted a second issue: even if the paste is in the middle of the text, the substring that is removed is from the end of the text. For example, I've entered some text here and copied the "questions" word:
<img width="1083" alt="Screenshot 2023-07-23 at 5 35 16 PM" src="https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/assets/48304907/eb5ba5f2-2a6a-4723-8b81-f46f229a927b">

After pasting the "questions" word into the whitespace in the centre, the text at the end (i.e. "hello") is gone:
<img width="1078" alt="Screenshot 2023-07-23 at 5 35 34 PM" src="https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/assets/48304907/81c50e0d-58da-41d9-9d2e-0daf613efb33">

I'm wondering if this behaviour would be expected by the user... I would think that the behaviour should be the pasted text gets truncated instead. If you agree, my suggestion would be to get the substring of the pasted text instead and paste it at its intended location. This might solve the first issue as well since we're not setting the content of the whole editor (though I'm not too sure).

Thanks @rexong for looking into the cause of the issue. I've tried some stuff but am unable to find a solution for the first issue... @domlimm any suggestions? If not, we can open a separate issue for it once this PR gets merged. Should also note that all other formatting (e.g. bold, strikethrough) also gets removed.

For the second part on the truncation of the pasted text, I've done up a quick snippet to see if it's possible:
```
const before = editor.getContent(``{`` format: 'text' ``}``);
setTimeout(() => ``{``
    const currentCharacterCount = this.getCurrentCharacterCount(editor);
    if (currentCharacterCount >= RICH_TEXT_EDITOR_MAX_CHARACTER_LENGTH) ``{``
        event.preventDefault();
        const after = editor.getContent(``{`` format: 'text' ``}``);
        var firstDifferentIndex = 0;
        while (after[firstDifferentIndex] === before[firstDifferentIndex]) ``{``
            ++firstDifferentIndex;
        ``}``
        const left = before.substring(0, firstDifferentIndex);
        const right = before.substring(firstDifferentIndex);
        const pastedTextLength = after.length - before.length;
        const pastedText = after.substring(firstDifferentIndex, firstDifferentIndex + pastedTextLength);
        const amountOver = currentCharacterCount - RICH_TEXT_EDITOR_MAX_CHARACTER_LENGTH;
        const truncatedPastedText = pastedText.substring(0, pastedTextLength - amountOver);
        const finalText = left + truncatedPastedText + right;
        editor.setContent(finalText);
``` 

I ran a couple of tests and it seems to work, @rexong can I leave it to you to make sure that it works with any edge cases as well? I also didn't get to the part on setting the cursor; the cursor should probably be set to the end of the (truncated) pasted text.

Note that your PR is not linking to the correct issue (in this case #12473). In any case, this PR does not mention how to use masquerade mode at all, and instead details how to create an instructor and log in. 

Please refer to the discussion in #12473 and familiarise yourself with the issue before attempting a fix. It would also be beneficial for you to run through the steps to make sure that they actually allow a developer to enter masquerade mode.

Hi @NyndoND, there are a couple of issues that I've spotted:
- There are some imports missing, which you'll need to create the test questions. I'll place them here for convenience:
```
import ``{`` QuestionTabModel ``}`` from './instructor-session-result-page.component';
import ``{`` FeedbackParticipantType, FeedbackQuestionType, NumberOfEntitiesToGiveFeedbackToSetting ``}`` from '../../../types/api-output';
```
- Small thing, but the second question should have `questionNumber: 2`
- You'll need to add the test questions to the component. You can do so by adding this line **before** `fixture.detectChanges();`: `component.questions = testQuestions;`. This is also the reason why you were unable to select a button
- Note that the component uses `ngFor`, meaning it's not clear which button you're selecting... won't be an issue with the test, but it might be better to specify by selecting the button using an id
- The rest should be fine - just click the button and the test will run correctly.

Hope this helps! I ran the test and it passes for me (:

Hi @theKelvincode, thanks for the changes! Just one last comment:

For masquerading as an instructor the instructions are: "[...] with the instructor's email as a parameter", while for a student the instructions are: "[...] appended with the student's email". Since both methods are using `?user=`, can we standardise the language used to minimise confusion? You can either change one to the other, or combine them together, e.g. "[...] with the instructor's email appended as a parameter".

Hi @singhabhyudita, unfortunately I don't think we should be getting the response rates for all sessions when we populate the table... it will likely cause a huge performance issue, especially given that there might be many sessions ongoing during the range selected.

@Zxun2 has kept the original response rate behaviour by introducing a `cell-with-response-rate` component (`tm-response-rate`) and using that in the `sessions-table` component. When setting the row data of the table,  he calls the `createCellWithResponseRateComponent` (relevant lines: 254 and 293-311) which then creates the `tm-response-rate` component with the original functionality. Note that upon clicking the "Show" button, it triggers the `loadResponseRateEvent` which in turn calls the `loadResponseRateEventHandler` with the relevant index. (@Zxun2 lmk if I got this wrong!)

I think you can try doing something similar here - no need to worry about code duplication for now. Alternatively, you can wait until #12501 gets merged, which I suppose might be about next week since it's a large PR (will get to reviewing it this week).

Hi @singhabhyudita, a couple of comments to work on first:

Initially, the "Institution Name" button is disabled, indicating that the panels are sorted by institution name. However, that's not the case - clicking on "Institution Sessions Total" and back to "Institution Name" gives in a different sort order. Do ensure that the initial sort order is correct.

The sorting by start and end dates are also incorrect. Intuitively, the sort should be by a date comparison, so for example, ascending means that the dates should get later further down the rows. However, it seems that the current comparison is just based on strings, meaning that (for an ascending sort) Fridays will come first, then Mondays, etc, regardless of the actual date.

Will take a closer look at the code once these are fixed

> For the start and end dates I just used the existing enums. On taking a closer look I found out that the `SESSION_START_DATE` and `SESSION_END_DATE` are being sorted lexicographically in the table-comparator service file.

You're right that they are being sorted lexicographically; however, the underlying data is being stored as a number (timestamp) rather than the string. Hence, when sorted, the numbers are compared which produces the correct result. You can see this in action by going to the `compareLexicographically` method of the `table-comparator.service.ts` and logging `strA` and `strB`. When the admin sessions table is sorted, they output a date string; when say the sessions table in the instructor home page is sorted, they output a number representing the date.

My suggestion is to take a closer look at how the sessions table in the instructor home page is handled, including the `createDateCellWithToolTip` which you'll see transforms the timestamp (a number) into the string value to be displayed to the user. Some changes will probably be needed to be made to the `OngoingSessionsModel` (which I'm not sure why is defined in the response rate cell component... would have thought leaving it in the admin sessions page component would be better). I think now only the string is stored - either store both, or only store the `endTime`/`startTime` and then convert it to a string later on.

Don't see any issue with that, though I'm not sure if it's easier or cleaner than the current approach. (Do note that, although unlikely, there might be an issue with this that might be uncovered later.)

> Also the `OngoingSessionsModel` has been shifted to `cellWithResponseRateComponent` because there was a dependency cycle being created since the ongoing sessions object was being passed into the response rate component.

Hmm haven't taken a close look at the code, but is there any difference with the `cell-with-response-rate.component.ts` being used in the `sessions-table` component? For quick reference, here are the inputs being used there:
```
  @Input() responseRate: string = '';
  @Input() idx: number = 0;
  @Input() empty: boolean = false;
  @Input() isLoading: boolean = false;
  @Input() onClick: () => void = () => ``{`` ``}``;
```
My intuition is that the implementation of this should be the same, not too sure why the ongoing sessions object is being passed in. Do let me know if I've missed something (and feel free to modify or add to the fields in the ongoing sessions object).

Hi @singhabhyudita, apologies for the delay - been rather busy. Thanks for the changes to the sorting by start and end date within tables, those work fine now. Before we take a closer look at the actual implementation, could you help to fix the following issues?

I first sort the panels by "Institution Sessions Total", which gives the following result:
<img width="1278" alt="1 - sort by sessions total" src="https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/assets/48304907/36d0dad8-128b-470a-bf95-765318dd832c">

Afterwards, I increase the date range and click "Filter by Range". This gives the following result:
<img width="1262" alt="1 - incorrect sort" src="https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/assets/48304907/5517d2c3-4009-443e-8ebd-8708898de8d9">

As can be seen, even though the "Institution Sessions Total" button is still shown to be selected, the panels are not sorted accordingly. I think that either the Sort By should be sorted by whatever is currently selected, or it should reset to "Institution Name" (and the button should also reset). Both approaches are fine.

Further note that the panels are also not correctly sorted by Institution Name ("test" should be after "TEAMMATES Test Institute 1"). This is likely related to the next issue:

2. Issue with initial sort by institution name

After setting a date range and pressing "Filter by Range", I get the following sort:
<img width="1288" alt="2 - initial" src="https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/assets/48304907/284c71aa-e1bd-44bb-bef1-6d0369e0a981">

However, the sort above is incorrect. After pressing "Institution Sessions Total" and then back to "Institution Name", I get the following correct sort:
<img width="1284" alt="2 - correctly sorted" src="https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/assets/48304907/83d885df-4304-44a4-8c94-be273c9b2e91">

The sort should be correct even upon the initial loading.

3. Panels not closing properly

I first set the date range and press "Filter by Range". Then, I sort by "Institution Sessions Total". Afterwards, I try to close the first panel; however, the panel does not close, even though the icon shows that it is closed. Upon pressing it again (to open the already open panel), I get what appears to be 2 tables under 1 panel:
<img width="1298" alt="3 - 2 tables" src="https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/assets/48304907/41a7e430-5980-40a4-8583-28a4fbf8cf62">

Furthermore, after trying to close the panel, one of the tables disappears, while one remains:
<img width="1259" alt="3 - icon shows closed but open" src="https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/assets/48304907/b98265a4-e070-4315-8ea7-68bf753e4f6e">

Note that the icon shows that the panel is closed, yet there is a table still visible beneath it.

Do let me know if you have any trouble recreating these issues.

Hi @rexong, looks great (: Only one small nit: could you change `isLoadingSoftDeleteCourses` to &lt;code>isLoadingSoftDelete**d**Courses&lt;/code>? I think this is more consistent with the other `Loading` variables like `isLoadingArchivedCourses` as well as variables such as `softDeletedCourses` and `softDeletedCourse`

Hi @Rajdeep1311, some quick suggestions:
- Perhaps we should swap the 2 commands around (i.e. put `docker compose` command first) since that is the direction Docker is going towards. Then, we can suggest the alternate `docker-compose` command if the first one doesn't work
- For external URLs, let's add a hyperlink to some text, so for example "For more information, you may refer to the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/)"

> I have already updates the snapshots. There are a few errors in the specs. Basically since I have moved the action buttons into another component, the button calls in the specs file are giving errors. Do I simply delete them?

Deleting the tests doesn't sit right with me... for example, disabling the enrol button when an instructor cannot modify students seems an important feature to test. I think we should still be testing functionality, but perhaps the tests could be shifted to different components. I suppose a way to keep the tests within `instructor-courses-page.component.spec.ts` is to traverse the DOM to look for the correct button, but then that's quite prone to breaking with any format changes, and also doesn't really fit with the purpose of spec tests (i.e. to test that particular component).

With the above in mind, I think that the way forward is to shift the spec tests into their relevant components. For example, the test for disabling the enrol button could be shifted to the `cell-with-actions` component. @singhabhyudita do let us know if this would require a significant amount of work - we can always have it as a separate PR.

I also took a look at the other failing spec tests and noted that the "should load all courses by the instructor" test is failing - I think this one should be fixed and left in the `instructor-courses-page.component.spec.ts` file.

@zhaojj2209 / @samuelfangjw / @wkurniawan07 - would appreciate any advice; am not too sure if shifting the tests into the newly-created components is the best approach, or if it might require too much setup.

Thanks @rexong! Is the `clickable` CSS class still relevant? I removed it from the HTML and still saw a pointer on hover.

Also, when using a screen reader, the element is being read as a "visited link" - not sure if that's appropriate in this instance. I would suggest adding `role="button"` to each of the elements; then, the screen reader will simply tell the user that it is a button, removing the confusion of "visited" and "link". (A button also seems more similar to what the "Show" element does, which is a [clickable element that triggers a response when activated by the user](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/button_role))

> Regarding the second point, would it be better if we change the tag from an `&lt;a>` tag to a `&lt;button>` tag instead?

Hmm not too sure about this... @ seniors (@zhaojj2209 @samuelfangjw @wkurniawan07) do you foresee any issues with the change from `&lt;a>` to `&lt;button>`? I think the "Show" element behaviour and functionality is more like a button, but am unclear as to why it was implemented as a link.

~@rexong in any case, I think we can keep it as `&lt;a>` for this PR, since any change will likely have to be implemented in other components as well that go beyond the scope of this issue~

Hi @rexong, behaviour looks fine now but do take a look at the failing E2E test. In particular, it seems to be failing because the dropdown is now outside the `courseTab` element. You can take a look at the other methods in `InstructorHomePage.java` to see how this is being handled (e.g. in `publishSessionResults()`)

For this question, I set all options to have empty weights. I noted two possible areas of improvement:
1. The "Average" (and "Total") columns for Response Summary and Per Recipient Statistics (Per Criterion) should probably indicate that the average is not calculable, given that the answers all have empty weights. I would suggest indicating something like `-`. What do you think?
2. For the Per Recipient Statistics (Overall), the "Total" and "Per Criterion Average" columns should follow the same indication as above. In addition, the "Average" column should also show the same thing, instead of the `NaN` it shows now

Hi @dlimyy, fix looks good! I would suggest shifting the `ceil` implementation into the `QuestionEditDetailsFormComponent` base class (`question-edit-details-form.component.ts`), since it now can be used for 3 different question types. Then, you can delete the 2 functions in the constsum classes, as well as edit the numscale html file to use the `ceil` function.

This includes unnecessary formatting changes". As far as I can tell, the relevant changes are only to 5 lines.

Do also note that we typically align multi-line parameters to the first parameter (e.g. line 109), or add an additional tab to indicate that the parameter list is still ongoing. When we chain operations together on a variable, we also either align to the first operation or add an additional tab as a visual indicator (e.g. line 164).

We will proceed to review your PR after the changes have been made.

Hi @iJonezi, sorry for missing this PR! As per our contribution guidelines, all PRs must address an open issue - could I trouble you to open an issue detailing the changes you wish to make and why there are necessary?

I took a quick look through the changes, and some of them seem to be personal formatting preferences - as long as the current documentation doesn't impede understanding of users (and work of developers), we tend hold off changes; else, we might have a ton of PRs changing details that end up being inconsequential

Hi @leesooy01, can you please elaborate how this PR solves the issue? Here are my concerns:
- You are implementing a spinner, when there is already a spinner component we are using (e.g. in the Instructor's Home Page, you can see it when the page first loads)
- Even if the correct way was to implement a new spinner, we should implement it as an Angular component for reusability and with the appropriate tests (see other components for more details)
- You mention that it replaces the loading icons. I don't see that replacement in the changes
- The issue raised by #10425 is still not solved. For example the "Save changes" button for a question in the edit feedback session page still adds the spinner to the button rather than replacing its icon.

As a side note, please ping us when your PR is ready for review (and no longer a draft).

Do let me know if you need further clarification.

Hi @hallovera, do fix the lint issues as well as the failing snapshot tests. You can update the snapshots by running` npm run test` and pressing `a` to run all test cases. After that, check through the snapshots to make sure the changes are as expected, then press `u` to update them. You can find more details on snapshot testing [here](https://teammates.github.io/teammates/snapshot-testing.html).

Would suggest replacing this with `this.sortCoursesBy(this.sortBy)`, the rationale being that there is already a function that does this functionality, and also this change makes it easier for others to see at a high level what is going on (i.e. that we are sorting courses by the current/default sort by)

Hi @averheecke-scottlogic, thanks for the PR! The button now shows that the default sort is by creation date, however I don't think that that is the actual behaviour.

Here is my student home page immediately after loading (I've closed the panels for clarity):

Upon clicking on the "Course ID" button, the sort remains exactly the same. When I click back onto the "Creation Date" button, the sort becomes as such:

It appears that even though the button indicates that the default sort is by creation date, the sort is still by Course ID. Could you please take a look?

> Hello @weiquu, This is my first time contributing to a open source and accidentally committed the `package-lock.json `. I have a quick question should I be raising a PR to fix the previous PR or should I just raise new PR with just the changes in it?

The best approach would be to revert the `package-lock.json` to the previous commit (i.e. the one on the `master` branch). There are a couple of resources online of how to do so using git, for example [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/git-revert-file-reverting-a-file-to-a-previous-commit/) and [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/215718/how-can-i-reset-or-revert-a-file-to-a-specific-revision). I would strongly suggest using this approach, since it will get you more familiar with git and will likely be useful in your future software development.

Of course, if you're unable to, you can always close this PR and open a new one with the same changes (without committing the `package-lock.json` file). However, please try the above approach first.

I think in generally, we would rather have the user see the overflow, since at least they can still use the functionality.

In this case, can just remove the `overflow-` entirely. The default behaviour (i.e. no change) is fine

Hi @Tejasker, can you check out the failing tests? You might need to check out the relevant `spec.ts` file for the failing component tests (should be `instructor-home-page.component.spec.ts`), and the `InstructorHomePageE2ETest.java` file for the failing E2E tests. You can see more details on where it failed by clicking on the "Details" button next to the failed checks.

I've taken a quick look and it seems that the tests can't find the archive and delete buttons by the `.btn-archive-course` and `.btn-delete-course` classes. I assume it's something to do with the container they are in (i.e. they are no longer a child of the component we are looking at), but I'm not too sure. Do check on this and let us know if you are facing any issues (and what you have tried).

There are also a couple of snapshot tests that are failing. You can update the snapshots by running `npm run test` and pressing `a` to run all test cases. After that, check through the snapshots to make sure the changes are as expected, then press `u` to update them. You can find more details on snapshot testing [here](https://teammates.github.io/teammates/snapshot-testing.html).

Hi @Tejasker, thanks for fixing the snapshot tests. Note that the other tests are still failing - please refer to the first 2 paragraphs of my previous comment for some guiding info.

In particular, the `container="body"` line is causing the dropdown to be added as the last child of the `body` element. This means that previous ways to find the button for testing no longer work. You can take a look at the Instructor Feedback Sessions page for an example. Lines 243-258 of `InstructorFeedbackSessionsPage.java` should also give you an idea of how to fix the E2E tests - these should then be transferrable to the component tests.

> Hii @weiquu once you are OK with my above responses for the change requested, Then I can raise a PR

Hi @Tejasker, replying to the E2E and component tests comments here:

I think my suggestion of `body > div > div > .btn-delete-course` (and similarly for `.btn-archive-course`) works because we are still directing the query down the same path to the button. I've checked that this works with a test PR which you can view [here](https://github.com/weiquu/teammates/pull/7). You can verify that all checks pass, and under the [files changed](https://github.com/weiquu/teammates/pull/7/files) section, that I've used `body > div > div > .btn-delete-course`. If I'm not wrong, querySelector needs a reference to the parent element of the element we are finding, which is why the examples you've given above do not work.

Let me know if the above makes sense. If it's okay, please go ahead and make the changes to the same branch (i.e. use this same PR)

Hi @domoberzin, thanks for the PR, looks quite comprehensive so far!

Could you update the methods and action to use `Student` instead of `StudentAttributes`? The `*Attributes` classes are used for the datastore, so we shouldn't be using those in the migrated methods. E.g. the `updateStudentCascade` method should take in `Student` instead of `StudentAttributes`, and following that there'll need to be some small change within the `EnrollStudentsAction` file as well 

(Feel free to separate the pre-migration and post-migration code into 2 big chunks if that's easier - no need to try and extract out common parts since the pre-migration code will eventually be removed. So you can just do something like: `if (!isCourseMigrated(courseId)) ``{`` [whole chunk of pre-migration code] ``}`` else ``{`` [whole chunk of post-migration code] ``}```, similar to other action migrations)

Hi @domoberzin, did you migrate the `AccountRequestSearchTest`? Not sure if the migration should be something like [this file](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/pull/12340/files#diff-4c00bcfd7108af463de1a67e77e733f50ff4dd7fa077f13c5ac8183c301281e5)

Not entirely sure about this... if I'm not wrong, the flow would be:
- Request body is of type SqlDataBundle
- Error thrown for `JsonUtils.fromJson(getRequestBody(), DataBundle.class)` since the 2 classes cannot be cast to each other (?)
- Uncaught error -&gt; sqlDataBundle is never called with method `sqlLogic.putDocuments`

Similar story if request body is of type `DataBundle`

I'd rather we keep the `card` class here because this div's children elements are using `card-header` and `card-body`, so logically the div should be a `card`.

The issue of the excess margin actually comes from the `instructor-course-edit-page` component - if you take a look at line 2, the `card` class is being applied to the div surrounding the `course-edit-form` component, hence the extra padding. Simply removing the class there should resolve the issue, similar to how the `instructor-edit-panel` component is used (lines 19-33)

@EuniceSim142 if you think it's too much change, we can leave this as a future issue, similar to [this](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/pull/12738#discussion_r1495257696) (maybe open an issue consolidating these so that we don't forget these potential optimisations - I suppose we'll only get to it after migration is merged)

But if you think it's fine we can do it in this PR as well - seems to just be transferring this logic to the db:
`(now.isAfter(startTime) || now.equals(startTime)) && now.isBefore(endTime);`

Personally prefer keeping it for a future PR (i.e. do an exact migration first, then optimise so that it's easier to ensure correctness), but up to you to make the decision

@EuniceSim142 shall we test for the `getFeedbackQuestionsForGiverType` method as well? Just pass in a `FeedbackSession` that has injection strings in name / email / etc. I think the other methods that use `UUID` don't need to be tested. Do also fix the lint checks

> @weiquu there shouldn't be a need to migrate this class. The email being generated here is only sent to admin, and the process does not go through the logic layer at all.

Should the test file still be moved to the new folder then? Same question for `QueryLogsAction` and `CreateFeedbackSessionLogAction` since I think for those 2, the actions themselves have no changes (for `GetFeedbackSessionLogsAction` there might need to be changes since it's still using the` *Attributes` classes)

Please refer to the tele msg! basically:
- add test to .xml file
- create a new json file, don't add on to the _sqlentities file

i suppose that the current failing check is because of the second point because the migration generally looks fine...

Hi @yuanxi1, thanks for the research! I think the temp fix is fine - we'll probably try to resolve this when refactoring entities. Could you add the test to the `.xml` file so that it runs on github actions? Can take a look at the tele message for more details

The lint issues are caused by the `spotBugs` checks, so we need to suppress the `FindBugs` warnings. See comments below, still need to add `import edu.umd.cs.findbugs.annotations.SuppressFBWarnings;` right above `import jakarta.persistence.CascadeType;`

In the instructor home page, clicking on the "Remind" dropdown causes the dropdown to be expanded within the table itself (rather than over it).

Accessibility tests are failing due to the `rubric-question-response` component. In particular, the body of the table has id `rubric-answers`, but this component appears for each rubric question response, meaning that there might be multiple `rubric-answers` ids on the same page.

To re-create such a page, create a feedback session with rubric questions, respond to the session with a couple of students, then go to student pages and view responses for the feedback session.

Any fix should note that the `FeedbackResultsPage` E2E test makes use of the `rubric-answers` id, so there needs to be some changes there as well.

When editing the session, it's possible to have the submission opening time be set earlier, in which case the session visibility time becomes invalid:
![Screenshot 2023-12-12 at 6 27 46 PM](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/assets/48304907/a0b01ac1-3f76-4cde-bc07-4c03d7871e87)

I think that in such a scenario, having the session visibility time default to the submission opening time is appropriate behaviour. This is somewhat similar to the case when submission opening time is set to be after submission closing time - in that scenario, submission closing time defaults to submission opening time.

Also open to discussion as to whether this behaviour is expected by the user or not

This seems to be an unintentional change cause by #12591, in particular the following addition to `styles.scss`:
```
  .btn-info ``{``
    background-color: darken(#0DCAF0, 3%); // 3% darker than info
  ``}``
```

The background colour is being used by another button in another page; moreover, it's unclear why the buttons in the students dropdown is of class `.btn-info` when no other dropdown button has that class (they have `.button-light` instead, but even that class seems to be redudant).

My suggestion is to simply remove that class from the affected buttons, as well as to ensure that no other buttons are affected. I've taken a quick look and this seems to be the only case, though I might have missed something.

Mousing over the tooltips for instructor comments causes the text to go into the next line, which can be jarring for the user. Here is the normal view:

While addressing this issue, do also try to address the following:
- The visibility eye icon should have dotted lines under it as well, to indicate that users can mouse over for more information. Not sure if the icon itself is clear enough to indicate that the info is about visibility - feel free to suggest alternatives
- When a comment has been edited, the screen reader reads the first line ("Instructor commented at 16 Dec 4:37pm") twice. Not sure what is causing it, possibly some wrapping of the elements. Do take a look into this as well, but we can shift to another issue if needed

![comment buttons](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/assets/48304907/ac54af08-80d1-49b4-be38-20672949098a)

Let's add a description that the screen reader can pick up.

In addition, the buttons when adding/editing a comment are picked up in the wrong order by the screen reader. Here is the buttons (discard and save) for editing a comment; the same issue exists for adding a comment (cancel and save):
![discard and save buttons](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/assets/48304907/03a378ca-3f4d-4770-9c8d-43938cf086e7)

The screen reader first goes to Save and then Discard. Let's change the ordering so that the screen reader goes to Discard and then Save, to follow the visual order on the page

Hi @rahulpro2001, if I'm not wrong, the comment button is being picked up by the screen reader correctly. You can enable your own screen reader to check. I'm on mac, so [here](https://www.apple.com/voiceover/info/guide/_1121.html#:~:text=VoiceOver%20is%20a%20built%2Din,VoiceOver%2C%20press%20Command%2DF5.) are the commands I use - if you're using a different OS, I'm sure you can find the instructions of how to enable their screen reader online.

Regardless, do ensure that all buttons are being correctly read by the screen reader and in the right order when you eventually submit a PR (i.e. please resolve this issue fully).

%%[created at: 2023 Dec 16 17:05:34]%%

When editing a comment, the button for cancelation of editing is named "Discard", which is quite misleading - my instinct would be to assume that this deletes the comment entirely, rather than "discarding" the edit:
![discard and save buttons](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/assets/48304907/25cf317c-531a-4f98-90f5-a579542f6dfd)

Possibly a better wording would be Cancel, as is common in other website (e.g. Github):

In a similar vein, pressing "Save" even when no edits have been made to a comment causes the comment to show up as edited - I'm not sure if this behaviour is intended or intuitive. Open to discussion.

The delete icon on the comment might also be better in red?

Hi @cschetan77, I assume that you have found the student records page; if not, please log in as an instructor, find a student, and click on All Records (that URL will look something like http://localhost:4200/web/instructor/students/records?courseid=instructor.gma-demo&studentemail=alice.b.tmms@gmail.tmt).

After that, scroll down to any panel that has a Moderate response button. When the panel is open, clicking the button closes the panel instead of bringing the user to the moderate response page:

The second issue to resolve has to do with the screen reader. You should find out how to enable the screen reader on your computer, and navigate to the button using the screen reader controls.

</div>

%%[created at: 2023 Dec 17 04:37:58]%%

Fairly often I've found myself (and seen others) commenting the following text (or something similar) on PRs:

> You can update the snapshots by running `npm run test` and pressing `a` to run all test cases. After that, check through the snapshots to make sure the changes are as expected, then press `u` to update them. You can find more details on snapshot testing [here](https://teammates.github.io/teammates/snapshot-testing.html).

The frequency of this issue's occurrence points to it being a problem with our documentation (or possibly something workflow related) rather than with individual contributors.

I've gone through the dev docs, and the sections relevant to snapshot tests are:
- Development -&gt; Testing -&gt; [Running the tests](https://teammates.github.io/teammates/development.html#testing), which doesn't really mention how to update tests. It's also worth mentioning that if `npm run test` is ran after changes are made (which I find is often the case in my own development), sometimes no tests are ran at all, giving the impression that there are no changes needed to tests
- [Snapshot Testing](https://teammates.github.io/teammates/snapshot-testing.html), which mentions the default verification mode and how the auto-update mode is activated by pressing `u`

Unfortunately, the link between the 2 pages is not made explicit - the first doesn't mention snapshot testing, and the second doesn't mention the `npm run test` command.

My suggestion is to amend the docs such that this process is made clearer. For example, we could amend the Development page to link the snapshot tests to the command (and options), as well as add in a point to the Process page, which the generated PR description points to. Even just a paragraph mentioning the text (see above) would be useful, so that we could give contributors the link to it.

Possibly a checklist of test commands to run in the PR description would also be helpful, though I seem to remember some reservations about making the PR description too long.

Hi @domoberzin, the issue with the toast message above seems to be caused by lines 804-805 in `instructor-course-edit-page.component.ts`. I combined them into a single line and the toast message looked fine for me.

Could you also try setting the whitespace property to `break-spaces` and see if the E2E tests still fail? If so, then I think we can just go with your suggestion.

@domoberzin I think you can also check which tests usually have to be ran multiple times by going into a PR and checking E2E test details, then seeing which need multiple runs before passing. Will take a look at this also

Hi @AndrewVreeland, thanks for researching the issue. May I know what issue you're facing regarding the running of the backend? I think it would be better if we resolve that so that you are able to verify the solution on your own (: 

Here's my suggestion: do open up a [discussion](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/discussions) so that we can try to troubleshoot your backend issue. In the meantime, you can open up a PR with the solution you've outlined if you want, and I'll see if it resolves this issue.

Hi @yangyangdotcom, I'm still able to replicate the bug on my end. I'm on mobile, and here are the steps I took:
- Login as instructor
- Navigate to instructor courses page
- On the first active course, click on other actions button
- The result is below:

Hi @singhabhyudita, I'll only have time to take a closer look this weekend... in the meantime, could you highlight some of the issues faced? I think that would also be useful when we're refactoring other pages. Would of course prefer if the `sortable-table` component is used, since I believe that's the more extensible approach (and we can abstract away the sorting functions)

Hi @lucasfs1007, can you give more examples of what you seek to implement? It seems that you're just testing email validation, and not "[creating] more efficient abstractions". I'm also not sure what you mean by manually authorising forms.

If you could also provide details about what problems have arisen/might arise due to our current email validation, that would be great as well.

Hi @Valentinnin, one of the methods I use is to first inspect the web page (e.g. using Chrome developer tools) and find the element that I want to change. Around that element, there should be a tag starting with `tm-`, which indicates the component that I'm looking for. From there, I go into my code editor and do a search for that component, and that usually brings up the relevant files.

Hope this helps! Do let us know if you run into any other issues

Hi @Ravinkumar2264, as far as I'm aware, we don't send emails to students to join the course. See the below message (Instructor -&gt; Students -&gt; Send Invite):

> Usually, there is no need to use this feature because TEAMMATES sends an automatic invite to students at the opening time of each session. Send a join request to [email] anyway? 

The instructor has the option to trigger the invitation to join the course manually, either for all students or for individual students.

As you've pointed out, the student will receive an email for when the feedback session is about the expire, as well as right before it opens and when it opens (these details are in the create feedback session page).

I've done some checks and the emails send out accordingly.

Let me know if I've understood you correctly, and whether you've pointing out an issue or suggesting a possible enhancement. In the future, please also provide exact steps to reproduce the issue.

Hi @Ravinkumar2264, I'm afraid I can't reproduce the issue. Can you give the exact steps you followed, as requested previously? Here are mine:
1. Log in as instructor
2. Go to the enrol students page of a course
3. Enrol a student
4. Go to the course details page and click on send invite for that particular student
5. Click on Yes in the popup
6. The email should have been sent to the student's email

> However, are we actually certain that this is the actual cause of the issue?

Yes, this is due to the session cache in Objectify (https://github.com/objectify/objectify/wiki/Caching):

<img width="917" alt="image" src="https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/assets/67156011/47a9930d-ad56-40ea-911f-0c9a4092f3f2">

In particular, "The session cache holds your specific entity object instances. If you load() the same entity, you will receive the exact same Java entity object instance"

Hence, when updating the student deadlines in the current code, while the java entity object changes, the test case passes, as it is not fetching the entity from the db, rather it is using the current cached entity that was loaded previously, whose student deadlines were updated, but not saved to the db. 

To make the test case fail with the current code, I added Objectify.clear(); between the loading of the old and new feedback sessions.

Moreover, testing on the frontend on this branch does resolve the issue.

Thanks @jayasting98, I've made the changes requested

I've added a method in `BaseTestCaseWithLocalDatabaseAccess` to clear the objectify cache as the Architecture tests fail when i added it to `FeedbackSessionLogicTest` directly:

wld like to point this out, here we are letting e2e tests access the output, as its needed to do assertions (the old way with datastore was to convert the Data to the actual DTO, but that cannot be done now as the Data does not actually contain all the required fields to create the entity (this is due to SQL being relational, e.g. return FeedbackResponseData, we do not actually have the full course to create the entity)

see AbstractBackDoor.java for examples of how this Data -&gt; Entity is done in datastore, and i think its not possible for our new SQL setup

hi @dlimyy, I've looked into the issue, and I found that  `ClipboardEvent` is unfortunately not accessible by the test environment. 

A solution I've found to mock a paste event is as follows:


```
const inputElement = fixture.debugElement.query(By.css('#max-value')).nativeElement as HTMLInputElement;
inputElement.value = 'abc';
expect(inputElement.value).toBe('')

inputElement.value = '2333';
expect(inputElement.value).toBe('2333')

```

Do try it out and let me know if it works!

> Hi @cedricongjh, thanks for your help and suggestion! I have tested this out on my end but it does not seem to invoke the onPaste method in the process. If I changed `inputElement.value = "2.2"`, it returns `2.2` instead of `''`. I believed the reason why it worked for the 'abc' case is that the input type of `max-value` is number so any alphabetical characters passed in would get cancelled out. Since the node.js testing environment does not provide support for this ClipboardEvent, would it ok in this case to leave this method untested?

Ah that's unfortunate, let's leave that untested for now

I will work on adding the tests for these 3 functions.

hey @dlimyy I think it'll be much better if we added the checking for numbers that are too long in the `onPointsInput` method, we could do this by accessing the value of the input element like this:

```
(event.target as HTMLInputElement).value

> Hello @cedricongjh. I ran `npm run test` and all test cases are passing. There is no `u` option, but I ran it with `npm run test -- -u` to update, but there are no failing test cases. Any advice on why it is failing on GitHub cehcks?

Hey @anguye68, running it on my local machine, it seems that the test cases are failing. There is a possibility that the test cases pass on your end as there could be unpushed commits from your local branch, or a chance that the tests were running on the master branch. 

Running `npm run test`, followed by `a`, and then pressing `u` (after all the tests have run) updates the following snapshots for me:
`instructor-session-edit-page.component.spec.ts.snap` and `question-edit-form.component.spec.ts.snap`.

Do try the steps again, and let me know if you run into any further issues!

Hey @Mex7180, thank you for your PR! Just a couple comments:

1. As stated in the issue, there should add a confirmation modal for the user to confirm a reset.
2. It would be good if there's a test added for the resetRubricQuestion function

Left a few comments that I think should be addressed.

Also, I've discovered that when switching to the min date, the time always defaults to the min time, even when the time selected is valid (e.g. 13th Sept, 2359 is selected, but switching to 12th Sept (the minDate) causes the time to change)

hey @lunoos, while the eslint suggestion is valid, currently all our backend error responses follow the `ErrorMessageOutput` type, hence I do not think we should change it as that is what the actual backend returns. We should mock it correctly such that it returns the appropriate type for example:

```
    const customError: ErrorMessageOutput = ``{``
      error: ``{``
        message: errorMssg,
      ``}``,
      status: 0
    ``}``;

    const mockModalRef: any = createMockNgbModalRef(``{``
      isCopyFromOtherSession: false,
      courses: [],
      courseToFeedbackSession: ``{````}``,
      fetchFeedbackSessionsEvent: new EventEmitter<string>(),
    ``}``, Promise.reject(customError));

ah i see! if i'm not wrong, the list of mcqWeights does not necessarily have to be immutable for this class, and furthermore I think it's better if we keep it consistent with the rest of the test cases, where Arrays.asList is used when setting the mcqWeights, hence I think we should convert it to a normal list

hi @mhoualla as far as I know, the accessibility tests are not known to fail at times, however I also think that it's unlikely that the HTML structure would have changed due to the unit tests, I'll be monitoring and re-running the tests on github, but if you could spare some time, do try to run them locally to ensure that they pass on your branch as well

this description is not accurate, as we do not return responses based on selected section, rather we delegate the filtering to isFeedbackResponsesDisplayedOnSection, if none of the above conditions (missing responses, question type is not contrib, isUsingResponseToSelf and response recipient is not You) are true

instead of checking if the length is 1, a better test here would be to check if isFeedbackResponsesDisplayedOnSection is called with the expected parameters, let's use a spy and check that instead here

> Initially I put the `EmailGenerator` test for the SQL email generator into `src/test/java/teammates/sqllogic/api/` to mimic the data store email generator found in `src/test/java/teammates/logic/api/MockUserProvision.java` but got a seemingly unrelated error when component testing. I also realised that the tests adjacent to the above SQL folder did not make use of `BaseTestCaseWithSqlDatabaseAccess` class which the email generator test used.
> 
> I moved my test to `src/it/java/teammates/it/sqllogic/api/` where other tests that used `BaseTestCaseWithSqlDatabaseAccess` were found and it worked. Would this change be ok from a file structure point of view? I'm also not too sure why this fixed it, if you have any insight ont his @cedricongjh

The tests in the package `src/test/java/teammates/sqllogic/api/` are meant for unit tests, without database access (the package was likely not setup to connect to the db, hence the errors), while the tests in `src/it/java/teammates/it` are meant for integration tests, with access to the database, hence from a file structure point of view this is fine.

point for discussion: wondering if this is necessary @weiquu, I think other search actions use this as well, but I'm personally not a fan of this as `isCourseMigrated` incurs a DB transaction everytime, perhaps there's a better way to prevent duplicates from being entered (checking for equality of StudentData?)

hey @marquestye, apologies for being late to review this

I think it would be good to use this opportunity to standardize the update logic for our entities in this PR. Let's place the checking of validity of the entity in the logic layer, while the db layer should handle the entity not found cases, as the db layer should focus on interfacing with the db, while logic layer handles application logic

test cases LGTM, could I trouble you to add the method that is being tested in the test string e.g. it('canUserSeeResponse: should allow instructors to see responses when intent is INSTRUCTOR_RESULT'), this is something we are doing for newly added test cases as it makes it easier for future developers to see exactly which method is being tested

ah yes, good point, we should also change the log's format, to log `studentId` and `feedbackSessionId` as well, this way, when creating the Entity in SQL, we would only need to query by Id.

For `GetFeedbackSessionLogsAction`, we should be using `studentId` and `feedbackSessionId` too (instead of `email` and `feedbackSessionName`)

This will require FE changes (to change the logs format, as well as API request params), so let's change the BE here first and do the FE in a separate PR

> I see, could I double confirm if there are two changes to the same table, will the one come later in the same changelog overwrite the one in the earlier section? If that is the case, I agree that maybe the previous way of making per-release changelog is better. Release leader will need to create a new changelog after the release. We can add that in the workflow (cc @cedricongjh what's your opinion on this)

Yup I think we should let the release leader handle the new changelog creation

> Currently, the component test "MsqQuestionStatisticsComponent" in the file "src/web/app/components/question-types/question-statistics/msq-question-statistics.component.spec.ts" is failing. This is due to the code changes I made, which index the recipients based on email rather than name - which was needed in order to uniquely identify students. Unfortunately, with the logic needed to resolve this issue, I won't be able to pass this test.

hi @Hkovin, since you changed the logic, the tests have to change accordingly to reflect the change in logic as well, do go ahead and update the tests

&gt;!-- Issue title: [brief description of feature/enhancement] -->

**Description of feature/enhancement**
Currently, developers need to manually create spy objects that mock a service/component:

e.g. 
<img width="352" alt="image" src="https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/assets/67156011/3d188d31-0903-4ab6-bb6c-2fe2685d7016">

Let's create a testing utility function that automatically creates these spy objects for us

**Justification**
&gt;!-- Explain who will benefit (instructors, students, developers, etc.) and in what way. -->
This will improve the developer experience when writing tests, instead of having the developer having to repeat the mock object, they can simply call the function once to create the object for them. 

An added benefit would be that the spy object created be typed instead of `any`, and our IDEs would be able to autocomplete the method name for us whenever we are accessing the spy method of an object.

Entity builders for more readable tests

**Description of feature/enhancement**
Currently, we are creating entities for the purpose of testing in this manner:
<img width="347" alt="image" src="https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/assets/67156011/36adfceb-0f78-4bd1-a871-5a1a870c49e8">

This is pretty bad for readability, as there is alot of noise in the creation of the entities, making it hard to tell which details are relevant for the tests.

**Justification**
&gt;!-- Explain who will benefit (instructors, students, developers, etc.) and in what way. -->
By creating a builder for the entity, we can specify properties that are only relevant for tests, making it easier for developers to not only create entities but enhance readability of our test code as well. 
See: https://testing.googleblog.com/2023/10/include-only-relevant-details-in-tests.html


**Existing similar features and their shortcomings**
&gt;!-- Explain why existing similar features fall short of your expectation. -->
&gt;!-- This section can be skipped if there are no existing similar features. -->
A potential shortcoming would be our builder default parameters would need to be updated whenever changes to the entities occur.

According to the angular documentation, the way to test event emissions is by subscribing to it directly:

    comp.selected.pipe(first()).subscribe((hero: Hero) => (selectedHero = hero));

As for the error message: `There are students who do not exist in the course`, it triggers when a student's deadline is to be extended but that student cannot be found in the course for which the session is under. This does seem like very strange behaviour as it does not seem like it's possible for the user to select a student not in the course from the UI. A possibility I can think of is that the student was deleted in between the 2 deadline extensions API requests but that does sound very unlikely to me

The logic works as follows:

1. Frontend sends PUT request with `courseId` and `feedbackSessionName` as params
2. Backend searches for the feedback session in the db using the `courseId` and `feedbackSessionName`
3. If there are new students who have individual deadlines, check if all the students sent in the PUT request to update their deadlines are in the course
4. Load student emails in the course from the db using `courseId` as a filter, as the set of student emails in the course
5. Check if the emails in the update request are in set of student emails in the course

Given that the feedbacksession stores the student deadlines as a map of studentEmail to deadline, could it be the case where an existing student that has an individual deadline has their email address changed, and thus every request we make to update the deadline throws an error as that email is no longer in the course? (in sending a PUT request, the ones with existing deadlines are sent to the backend as well)

If my hypothesis is correct, there is a quick fix:

![image](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/assets/67156011/2a10e8ab-ee15-45ea-99e9-f2ced9998ff5)

Delete all the current individual deadlines (this would result in student deadlines being an empty set, and hence the check for `verifyAllStudentsExistInCourse` would be true), then add them all back (adds in the correct updated email, thus the check is valid and the update operation goes through)

The long term fix would probably be not to use emails for the key but instead the generated id of the student

> Is this because of caching, or are the extensions also recorded in some other place?

Deadlines extensions are also recorded under `FeedbackSession`:

![image](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/assets/67156011/e5cbe2f5-ebb9-4a51-a1b2-59683198632e)

This might explain the reason for the bug, as the student email recorded here is likely not updated

Perhaps this would fix it: https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/issues/12594#issuecomment-1742674441

Basically we set the map to empty (since it contains an invalid student email), and then give out the extensions again, this would be a temporary fix for the user. 

The long-term fix now would be to ensure that we update the deadline extensions map in `feedbackSession` when we update a student's email, which i can work on

yes there was this PR: https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/pull/12556 that was merged in since the last release, hence the difference in behaviour, it could be worth looking into why the team sort (and the other sorts as well) has an issue when sorted by ascending as @MaharshiPedu pointed out

> @EuniceSim142 shall we test for the `getFeedbackQuestionsForGiverType` method as well? Just pass in a `FeedbackSession` that has injection strings in name / email / etc. I think the other methods that use `UUID` don't need to be tested. Do also fix the lint checks

I don't think this works as having the sqli string in name and email of feedback session won't inject it into the sql query:
```java
cq.select(root)
                .where(cb.and(
                        cb.equal(fqJoin.get("id"), feedbackSession.getId()),
                        cb.equal(root.get("giverType"), giverType)));
```
the query only uses giver type and id which are typed, and name and email which contain the sqli are not used in the where clause.

If feedback session has no questions for a specific user type (ie student, instructor), an email won't be sent to the user:
this is the logic path to the part where feedback questions are checked:
- `sqlEmailGenerator.generateFeedbackSessionOpeningOrClosingEmails()`

Yes I agree that we maybe should be checking for this as well, but the original implementation (using datastore) does not include this. I'm reluctant to make changes to the logic as it might cause regressions.

We could, but I think this restructures some of the existing logic and might change the semantics for what a method should be doing. Maybe leave this for a future optimization?

IT tests have been added, and updated search action to use id to query db for account request entities.

AccountRequestSearchIndexing action also updated to not include `java.util.UUID:` for id field (Don't think it's necessary and makes converting from solr document field's value to UUID object easier)

I'm fine with this change. 
I think if ever in future we need an endpoint to get all account requests, likely will have to add back the `/pending` (to follow the precedent for existing classes, like `ResourceURIs.SESSIONS_ONGOING` and `ResourceURIs.NOTIFICATION_READ`)

Would it be better to directly use `AccountRequestStatus` and do a case-insensitive match. This way we don't have to create any new variables.
Something like this:
```java
String pendingValue = AccountRequestStatus.PENDING.name();  // 'PENDING'
if (!pendingValue.equals(accountRequestStatus.toUpperCase())) ``{``
```

If we set all the old account requests to approved, is it possible to result in inconsistencies with Accounts db?
Eg. if some account request in datastore has registeredAt == null, so not approved yet. If we migrate, then that account request will have status = approve, but regKey and regAt are null and no account in accounts db.

Looking at the previous discussion, I agree with you that this might not be necessary. But if we don't plan on removing the migration script after v9-migration is complete, we can just merge this in to ensure correctness.

LGTM, thanks for the hard work! 👍 

Just 1 thing to check: not sure if this has been discussed already but is the admin allowed to edit an account request regardless of the account request's status (including APPROVED)? 
I don't think allowing it will cause any consistency issues, just confirming the expected behaviour.

@jayasting98 @xenosf Kindly help double-check the correctness of AccountRequest-related changes 🙏  basically now CreateAccountRequestAction needs to handle the transactions independently rather than rely on the wrapper due to the race condition.

This part of logic seems repetitive, could we make it into a helper function for min/max check and pass in min or max as a param to that helper function? That also means instead of repeating similar messages one time for max and another time for min in `FeedbackConstantSumQuestionDetails.java` line 36-53, we could define the consts as String Templates using `$``{``variable``}``` to reduce the repeating code.

Thanks for the PR, but this change should not be needed as the migration script applies to datastore only. Since ARF project creates the new format of AccountReq in SQL, it should not affect the script.

How about remove the `/pending` at the end AND add a query param? e.g. `status` where the value can only be `pending=0` for now? If the status param receives other enum value then throw an error. In this way it would be more extensible in the future.
Btw Notification Read is a bit different from this case as ReadNotification is an entity alone.

> I've noticed that if we reverted back to the previous way of making a changelog per release, we can easily tag all changes with a single release tag which we can roll back later. I'm not too sure how the dev process would look? Perhaps after making a release can create a release changelog for the next release and all developers who make changes to the schema will append to that file?

I see, could I double confirm if there are two changes to the same table, will the one come later in the same changelog overwrite the one in the earlier section? If that is the case, I agree that maybe the previous way of making per-release changelog is better. Release leader will need to create a new changelog after the release. We can add that in the workflow (cc @cedricongjh what's your opinion on this)

Let's keep it to be displayed as one column in the table i.e. "Institute, Country" for simplicity and compatibility?
Because (1) currently the db's institute field contain both institute and country (i.e. it is a string editable by admin) (2) we are not using dropdown in the frontend for this field due to sensitivity of region v.s. country in some scenarios, so no guarantee on the format of country string

> Just 1 thing to check: not sure if this has been discussed already but is the admin allowed to edit an account request regardless of the account request's status (including APPROVED)? I don't think allowing it will cause any consistency issues, just confirming the expected behaviour.

Update on this: Yes we will allow editing approved request status. E.g. When the account request email got a typo and we want to re-send the join link to the correct email.

I agree with @jayasting98 that it will be best if we could do batching for fetching account requests as well, because performance might vary in different laptop a lot. You may refer to the method `doOperation`  in script `PatchUsageStatistics` (reference: #12970 ).

&lt;!-- Issue title: [brief description of feature/enhancement] -->

**Environment**: `master`

**Description of feature/enhancement**

Currently the AccountRequestUpdate parameters are passed in as separate parameters (see this [link](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/blob/4682dffb71e4566ed72a9e8a7b2b814e8d16f869/src/web/services/account.service.ts#L121-L136)).

We want to change it to take in one type as the parameter, instead of passing every parameters in separately. An example of how a type is passed in to represent all parameters: [link](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/blob/4682dffb71e4566ed72a9e8a7b2b814e8d16f869/src/web/services/course.service.ts#L139-L142)

**Justification**
&lt;!-- Explain who will benefit (instructors, students, developers, etc.) and in what way. -->

This refactors the code in a more maintainable way, as developers do not need to update the function parameters every time there is a change. Instead, they can just edit the typescript type.

Hi @SaquibKhanANU and @Akshay1018 , thank you for your interest. Currently there is an open PR by @Stain19 . If that is not merged but closed in the future, feel free to submit PR but for now you might want to look for another good first issue in TEAMMATES. Thank you:)

&lt;!-- Issue title: [brief description of feature/enhancement] -->

- **Environment**: `master`

**Description of feature/enhancement**

Before we introduced Account Request Form (#11878), admin add instructors in Admin Home Page (without the approve / reject stage) and the result is displayed as follows:

![telegram-cloud-photo-size-5-6116111692854311756-y](https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/assets/69516975/fe930e07-e8e2-4cd9-b920-a7ffd10d8b12)


With the Account Request Form, admin can see pending account request submitted by instructors in a scrollable table. (see more in #12933)
&lt;video src="https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates/assets/74132255/5707ba1c-753d-4742-a06d-8a7ebafd1153">

We want to combine the admin adding instructor flow into the instructor account request flow.

This will need:
1. Combine the old Result table and the new PendingAccountRequest table
2. Integrate the Approve / Reject stage for admin added request

**Justification**
&lt;!-- Explain who will benefit (instructors, students, developers, etc.) and in what way. -->

Instead of having two separate table in admin home page for account requests added by admin and for those submitted by instructors, combining the UI into one table makes it cleaner and less confusing.

@TomBurrows101 Hi thanks for trying to contribute, the error message is saying that you might want to look into the email content and check if your changes have led to changes in email content which fails `assertEquals` in `testGenerateFeedbackSessionEmails`

> @ziqing26 Thanks for responding so quickly. I know that the program is test generating an email to send out (`testGenerateFeedbackSessionEmails`), and then as a part of the test (`EmailChecker.java`) is comparing this email with `src/test/resources/emails/*.html`. What I don't know is, what the differences are between the generated file and the template file. As far as I can tell they are identical, do you know how I'd be able to inspect a file generated by `testGenerateFeedbackSessionEmails`, so I can check for differences?

@TomBurrows101  I have replied you in your merge request, kindly check it if that helps!

@John-Poulos Hi, feel free to use either way. You can break down the changes into suitable size commits to keep the PR organized.
