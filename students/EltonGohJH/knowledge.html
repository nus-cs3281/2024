ChatGPT just makes it so much easy to write and debug code. ChatGPT has really helped me to picked up the technology and tools mentioned below.
I find that GitHub Copilot is super helpful when writing boiler plates code and code in general.</p> <h3 id="vue-js">Vue.js<a href="#vue-js" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor"></a></h3> <p>During the semester, I learned the fundamentals of Vue.js, including the Vue lifecycle, creating Vue components, and working with both Vue 2 and Vue 3.
It was exciting to discover that my previous experience with React was easily transferable to Vue, which helped me to quickly grasp the fundamentals of the framework.</p> <p>While using Vue, I also realised the importance of having a huge community behind a framework.
When working with Vue, I find it harder to find solutions online as there are less resources available compared to React.
However, I still had a great time learning Vue and learning a new framework for Frontend.</p> <h4 id="resource-used">Resource used:<a href="#resource-used" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor"></a></h4> <ul><li><a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue docs</a>: This is the most valuable resource I used to learn Vue. The docs are pretty well written and easy to understand.
However, there are some parts that are not very well documented such as SSR.</li></ul> <h3 id="monorepo-and-monorepo-management-tools">Monorepo and Monorepo management tools<a href="#monorepo-and-monorepo-management-tools" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor"></a></h3> <p>During the semester, I learned about Monorepo and Monorepo management tools like Lerna, NPM Workspaces, and Turborepo.
I gained an understanding of the benefits that Monorepo provides, such as simplified version control, dependency management and sharing of configs.
I learned how Monorepo management tools can help with versioning and also help to speed up running test and building through concurrency and caching.</p> <p>Overall, I gained a greater appreciation for Monorepo and its management tools, and I can see how they can greatly simplify software development and improve efficiency.</p> <h4 id="resource-used-2">Resource used:<a href="#resource-used-2" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor"></a></h4> <ul><li><a href="https://lerna.js.org/">Lerna docs</a>: This is the main resource I used to learn about Lerna. The docs are pretty well written and easy to understand.</li> <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iU_IE6vnJ8">Fireship on monorepo</a>: This is a good summary video by Fireship which shares about what exactly is Monorepo and why it is useful.</li></ul> <h3 id="serverside-rendering-ssr">Serverside Rendering (SSR)<a href="#serverside-rendering-ssr" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor"></a></h3> <p>This is my first time actually working with SSR directly.
Prior to this, I only have a basic understanding of SSR, and I was not sure how it works.
Through learning how to migrate from Vue 2 and Vue 3, I have really learnt a lot about how SSR works and why is it needed.
Below are a list of things that I have learned about SSR:</p> <ul><li>How does SSR work and what are the benefits of using SSR?</li> <li>How does SSR differ from Client-Side Rendering (CSR)?</li> <li>What is client-side hydration and how does it work in conjunction with SSR?</li> <li></li></ul> <p>I am really glad that I have learnt about SSR as SSR will is getting more and more prevalent in the industry.</p> <h4 id="resource-used-3">Resource used:<a href="#resource-used-3" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor"></a></h4> <ul><li><a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue docs</a>: This is super helpful in understand about SSR in vue.</li> <li>Other than that, I think a lot of SSR and even CSR knowledge is learned from ChatGPT.</li></ul> <h3 id="webpack">Webpack<a href="#webpack" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor"></a></h3> <p>Previously, in all honesty I did not really know what Webpack is and how it works.
Webpack seems to just be a magical tool that just works.
Through updating of Webpack and attempting to migrate Vue 2 to Vue 3. I learned a lot about Webpack and what it does.
Below are a list of things that I have learned about Webpack:</p> <ul><li>What is Webpack and how does it work? (bundling etc.)</li> <li>Learned about different types of Webpack plugins</li></ul> <h4 id="resource-used-4">Resource used:<a href="#resource-used-4" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor"></a></h4> <ul><li><a href="https://webpack.js.org/">Webpack docs</a>: This is the main resource I used to learn about Webpack.</li></ul> <h3 id="i-learn-how-to-use-open-source-software">I learn how to use Open Source Software<a href="#i-learn-how-to-use-open-source-software" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor"></a></h3> <p>This is quite a random learning point, but I think it is important to mention.
Somehow, I handled a lot of upgrading of dependencies.
I learned how to safely update dependencies and ensure that it does not break a codebase.
I also learned the importance of reading the changelog and release notes of dependencies.</p> <p>I had a painful experience when I had to debug why html format has changed after running npm install.
The reason for this is that the developer of js-beautify has changed the way it formats custom tag but did not mention it in the release notes.
This caused a lot of tests to fail and I had to spend a lot of time debugging it.</p> <p>Through this experience, I learned the importance of ensuring that changes are documented properly and correctly.</p> <h3 id="gomock">gomock<a href="#gomock" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor"></a></h3> <p>I have learned to use GoMock, a mocking framework for Golang, which streamlines the creation of mock objects for unit testing. It helps with decoupling components, enabling the simulation of complex behaviors and interactions. I am surprised how easy it to use to mock complex behaviours.
Will definitely use it for Golang testing next time!</p> <h4 id="resource-used-5">Resource used:<a href="#resource-used-5" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor"></a></h4> <ul><li><a href="https://github.com/uber-go/mock">gomock docs</a></li></ul> <h3 id="yarn-workspaces">Yarn workspaces<a href="#yarn-workspaces" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor"></a></h3> <p>Yarn Workspaces is a feature of Yarn that simplifies handling multiple packages within a single repository by enabling shared dependencies and centralized script management. I learnt Yarn Workspaces while setting up the repository for the Twenty project.
Overall, it is a good experience as I learnt more alternatives to Lerna and NPM workspaces.</p> <h4 id="resource-used-6">Resource used:<a href="#resource-used-6" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor"></a></h4> <ul><li><a href="https://yarnpkg.com/features/workspaces">Yarn workspaces docs</a></li></ul></div> <nav id="page-nav" class="fixed-header-padding" data-v-e6005420><div class="nav-component slim-scroll" data-v-e6005420></div> <!----></nav></div> <footer><div class="text-center"><p>[<strong>This site was generated using <img src="https://markbind.org/favicon.ico" width="25"> <a href="https://markbind.org/">MarkBind 5.3.0</a></strong> on Sat, 2 Mar 2024, 6:13:39 UTC]<br> <span class="dimmed"><small><small>favicon.ico of this site was made by <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/authors/smashicons" title="Smashicons">Smashicons</a> from <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/" title="Flaticon">www.flaticon.com</a> is licensed by <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" title="Creative Commons BY 3.0" target="_blank">CC 3.0 BY</a></small></small></span></p></div></footer></div>
