it never executes real invocations of the mocked class.\n\n    I used Mockito to mock classes that the class being tested on has a dependency with, stub method calls (with `when`, `thenReturn`, `thenThrow`, etc) and verify interactions with the mocked class (with `verify` method).\n        ```java\n        MyClass expectedObject = new MyClass(\"id\");\n\n        myMockedClass = mock(MyClass.class);\n        // define the behavior of mocked class: instead of executing the real method, the mocked method only returns the expected object\n        when(myMockedClass.getObject(\"id\")).thenReturn(expectedObject);\n\n        // verify number of calls to stubbed method with mocked class\n        verify(myMockedClass, times(1)).getObject(\"id\");\n        ```\n\n    Additionally, I researched other concepts Mockito provides: `spy` (for partial mocking) and mocking of static methods (`mockStatic`), but never had a chance to work with them.\n    - Spy:\n        - partial mocking is done for Spy; ie. in comparison to mocks which don't execute the stubbed method (\"only fake object exists\"), for spy: some parts will use real method invocations (\"a real object exists and we are spy-ing on it\").\n\n    - Mocking of static methods:\n        - in older versions of Mockito, it's not possible to mock static methods, but with PowerMock (a third-party tool), it is possible in newer versions.\n        - instead of `mock`, use `mockStatic` to create a mock for a static class.\n\n    - `verify`\n        - I initially ran into some issues with `verify` and did more research into the cause;\n            In the Action-layer tests, since the mocked logic object is shared with all action test classes, the mocked object accumulates the count of calls to any of the mocked logic methods across multiple test cases.\n            Work-arounds:\n                1. create the mock whenever a new test case is called (like how it's done for logic and db layer classes) or\n                2. use `clearInvocations` method to clear to reset the invocation counts for a mock, between test cases.\n        - Takeaway: A mock will keep track of all its past invocations.\n\n    - Mocking void methods:\n        - Mockito's default behaviour for void methods: `doNothing` (ie. the mock does nothing, will not execute the real method)\n        - If void method has some complex behaviour: can use `doAnswer` (to define custom behaviour) or invoke the real method (`doCallRealMethod`, but this creates a dependency in unit test case)\n\nResources:\n- [TestNG Annotations](https://www.javatpoint.com/testng-annotations)\n- [Mockito: Spy vs Mock](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28295625/mockito-spy-vs-mock)\n- [Mocking Static Methods with Mockito](https://www.testim.io/blog/mocking-static-methods-mockito/)\n- [Handling void methods with Mockito](https://www.baeldung.com/mockito-void-methods)\n")])]),_v(" "),_c('h3',{attrs:{"id":"git"}},[_v("Git"),_c('a',{staticClass:"fa fa-anchor",attrs:{"href":"#git","onclick":"event.stopPropagation()"}})]),_v(" "),_c('pre',[_c('code',{pre:true},[_v("Over the course of the data migration, I learned how to rebase a branch and revert to a past commit.\nAdditionally, I did some research into other git commands used during development like force pushing a branch.\nI think my knowledge and understanding of Git has improved greatly, beyond merging, `git pull`, `git fetch` and `git push`.\n")])]),_v(" "),_c('h4',{attrs:{"id":"github-editor"}},[_v("Github Editor"),_c('a',{staticClass:"fa fa-anchor",attrs:{"href":"#github-editor","onclick":"event.stopPropagation()"}})]),_v(" "),_c('pre',[_c('code',{pre:true},[_v("A cool tip / trick I learned from my mentors / peers: change \".com\" in the github url to \".dev\" OR pressing \".\" when on a pull request page will open up the web editor for PR, making it very easy to submit PR reviews and review the code.\n")])]),_v(" "),_c('h3',{attrs:{"id":"oss-related"}},[_v("OSS-related"),_c('a',{staticClass:"fa fa-anchor",attrs:{"href":"#oss-related","onclick":"event.stopPropagation()"}})]),_v(" "),_c('h4',{attrs:{"id":"pr-code-reviews"}},[_v("PR / Code reviews"),_c('a',{staticClass:"fa fa-anchor",attrs:{"href":"#pr-code-reviews","onclick":"event.stopPropagation()"}})]),_v(" "),_c('pre',[_c('code',{pre:true},[_v("While reviewing pull requests for other maintainers, I realised there is still much I can learn about Angular, Bootstrap, and even about the codebase (eg. its structure).
