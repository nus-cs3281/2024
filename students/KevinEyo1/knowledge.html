Although keeping multiple jobs within the same workflow file is possible, sometimes it may be better not to. Jobs are run based on event triggers such as pull requests etc, but you must add it to the top. This meant that if you had multiple jobs in the same workflow file, they would all run when the event trigger was activated. If you wanted a trigger to only trigger a specific job, you would need to add a check to exclude all other jobs from that trigger.</p> <p>Pull request trigger by default has the types <code class="hljs inline no-lang">opened</code>, <code class="hljs inline no-lang">synchronize</code>, and <code class="hljs inline no-lang">reopened</code>.</p> <p><strong>Testing and debugging workflows</strong>
This can be done locally with the help of Docker and act.</p> <p>Benefits of local testing:

The action works such that issues and PRs are treated and checked for inactivity separately. This means that any updates done to a PR regarding this issue, will not reset inactivity for the issue.</p> <p>How unassign and stale actions work:</p> <ol><li>Stale action adds <code class="hljs inline no-lang">Stale</code> label to issue or PR based on inactivity (default 60 days)</li> <li>Unassign action routinely checks for this <code class="hljs inline no-lang">Stale</code> label, then checks whether it's been a set amount of days after the <code class="hljs inline no-lang">Stale</code> label has been added with no other activity (default 7 days)</li> <li>For issues passing the check before, it un-assigns users and removes <code class="hljs inline no-lang">Stale</code> label</li></ol> <p><a href="https://github.com/BoundfoxStudios/fairy-tale-defender/blob/develop/.github/workflows/project-management.yml#L105">Reference workflow of real-life example</a></p> <h5 id="solution-using-unassign-and-stale-actions">Solution using unassign and stale actions<a href="#solution-using-unassign-and-stale-actions" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor"></a></h5> <p>Add the <code class="hljs inline no-lang">Stale</code> label after 6 days and ping a reminder, then have the <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/unassign-contributor-after-days-of-inactivity">unassign-contributor-after-days-of-inactivity</a> run 1 day after.
It can also only check on issues that are actually assigned to someone, so that theres no redundancy.
<strong>Limitations:</strong></p> <ol><li>Any changes in PR regarding issue will not reset inactivity of issue, meaning if discussion and updates are done on the PR instead of the issue, the issue risks being <code class="hljs inline no-lang">Stale</code> and the user being unassigned despite them actively working on the PR.</li> <li>It can ping a general reminder (without resetting the inactivity) but it cannot ping the user directly with <code class="hljs inline no-lang">@username</code> in the reminder due to how the code is written. It is possible to separately ping the user in another comment but that will cause a reset in inactivity. This means slightly lower visibility for the reminder.</li></ol> <h5 id="improvements-for-limitation-1">Improvements for limitation 1<a href="#improvements-for-limitation-1" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor"></a></h5> <p>Building on unassign action, which at some point it might be better off just building our own unassign action for better integration and control
<strong>Check corresponding PR (requires more implementation)</strong>
Add additional check before setting <code class="hljs inline no-lang">Stale</code> label to check if corresponding PR has history.
This can be done through checking the list of open PRs and their descriptions whether it mentions the issue. It can also be done through looking at the issue’s history, for PRs that mention it, then checking the history of those PRs. This should be quite manageable since the number of open PRs at any point of time is still relatively low for Markbind’s scale.</p> <p><strong>Check corresponding issue (requires more implementation)</strong>
On any activity in PRs, check description to find issues linked to the PR, so activity on PR can be translated to activity on the issue as well by posting a comment on the corresponding issue or something of that nature. This might require checking for a specific issue that has the user assigned to avoid commenting on relevant but not directly linked issues, if the PR has multiple relevant issues. We can also only call it on commits instead of any activity, so as to avoid over-polluting the issue with comments.</p> <h5 id="improvements-for-limitation-2">Improvements for limitation 2<a href="#improvements-for-limitation-2" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor"></a></h5> <p><strong>Ping after unassign</strong>
Same as before, add <code class="hljs inline no-lang">Stale</code> level after 6 days, but don't need to ping the user, wait until unassign 1 day after, then ping the user that they have been unassigned and if they are still working on it, ask them to reassign themselves. This would likely fit better with a longer timeline.
This solves the visibility problem as it can directly ping the user as resetting the inactivity after the user has been unassigned wouldn't matter.</p> <p><strong>Implement our own stale action (requires more implementation)</strong>
Implement a simplified version of stale action that now allows pinging of user before applying the <code class="hljs inline no-lang">Stale</code> label.</p> <h4 id="pull-request-target">pull_request_target<a href="#pull-request-target" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor"></a></h4> <p>Due to security reasons, for permissions given to <code class="hljs inline no-lang">GITHUB_TOKEN</code>, the maximum access for pull requests from public forked repositories is restricted to only read, so it is not possible to add labels since there is no write access. GitHub introduced the <code class="hljs inline no-lang">pull_request_target</code> event that will bypass this restriction and give the token write access.
Pros:</p> <ol><li>It allows labelling of PR</li> <li>Increased security as base branch workflows can be trusted, protecting job from running modified and malicious workflows
Cons:</li> <li>It can only run on <code class="hljs inline no-lang">pull_request</code> events and not <code class="hljs inline no-lang">pull_request_review</code> events which means need to run on PR merge rather than on PR approved.</li> <li>This event runs in the context of the base of the pull request, rather than in the context of the merge commit, as the <code class="hljs inline no-lang">pull_request</code> event does. This could lead to security vulnerabilities if scripts run are not properly checked for malicious code.
Can be aided by seeking approval before running the job, refer to <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository#controlling-changes-from-forks-to-workflows-in-public-repositories">change repo settings</a></li></ol> <h5 id="alternative-implementations">Alternative implementations<a href="#alternative-implementations" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor"></a></h5> <p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67247752/how-to-use-secret-in-pull-request-review-similar-to-pull-request-target">Workaround</a>
Pros: this can allow for still triggering on PR approved
Cons: immensely complicates the workflow</p> <p>Personal Access Token (PAT)
Create a PAT with the necessary permissions and add it to your repository's secrets. Then, modify the workflow to use this secret instead of the <code class="hljs inline no-lang">GITHUB_TOKEN</code>.
Pros: this can allow for still triggering on PR approved
Cons: exposes your repository to risks if the forked code can access the token</p> <h3 id="github-actions-security">GitHub Actions Security<a href="#github-actions-security" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor"></a></h3> <ul><li><strong>Resource</strong>: <a href="https://dev.to/suzukishunsuke/secure-github-actions-by-pullrequesttarget-641">Using pull_request_target</a></li> <li><strong>Resource</strong>: <a href="https://blog.gitguardian.com/github-actions-security-cheat-sheet/">Security and Cheatsheet</a></li> <li><strong>Resource</strong>: <a href="https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/">Security Lab</a></li></ul> <p><strong>Specific version tags</strong>
When using third-party actions, pin the version with a commit hash rather than a tag to shield your workflow from potential supply-chain compromise, since tags can be adjusted to a malicious codebase state but commit hashes provide immutability.
This can be done by going to the codebase for the specific tag version and looking for the latest commit of the version desired and copying the commit’s full SHA from the url link.
Use:
<code class="hljs inline no-lang">uses: someperson/post-issue@f054a8b5c1271c37293245628f1cae047eff08c9</code>
Instead of:
<code class="hljs inline no-lang">uses: someperson/post-issue@v7</code>
Downside is that the updates must be done by updating the commit hash instead of it being done automatically through moving the tag to a new release.
This can be solved by using tools like Dependabot or Renovatebot by adding a comment of the version used, enabling automated dependency updates. Tools like StepSecurity can also be used.</p> <p><strong>Minimally scoped credentials</strong>
Every credential used in the workflow should have the minimum required permissions to execute the job.
In particular, use the ‘permissions’ key to make sure the GITHUB_TOKEN is configured with the least privileges for each job.
<code class="hljs inline no-lang">permissions</code> can be restricted at the repo, workflow or job level.
<strong>Environment variables</strong>, like <code class="hljs inline no-lang">${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}</code>, should be limited by scope, and should be declared at the step level when possible.</p> <p><strong>Pull_request_target</strong> (must be used for write access if PR is from forked repo)
Do not use actions/checkout with this as it can give write permission and secrets access to untrusted code. Any building step, script execution, or even action call could be used to compromise the entire repository. This can be fixed by adding code to ensure that the code being checked out belongs to the base branch, which would also be limiting since the code checked out is not up to date for the PR.
This can be done using:</p> <pre><code class="hljs"><span>- uses: actions/checkout@v4
</span><span>  with:
</span><span>    ref: $ 
</span></code></pre><p>Triggers workflows based on the latest commit of the pull request's base branch.
Even if workflow files are modified or deleted on feature branches, workflows on the default branch aren't affected so you can prevent malicious code from being executed in CI without code review.
Another solution that allows <code class="hljs inline no-lang">pull_request_target</code> with <code class="hljs inline no-lang">actions/checkout</code> used on the PR branch, is to add an additional step of running workflow only on approval by trusted users, such that the trusted user has to check the changes in the code from the PR to ensure there is no malicious code before running the workflow.</p> <p><strong>Untrusted input</strong>
Don't directly reference values you do not control, such as <code class="hljs inline no-lang">echo “${{github.event.pull_request.title}}”</code>, since it can contain malicious code and lead to an injection attack.
Instead use an action with arguments (recommended):</p> <pre><code class="hljs"><span>uses: fakeaction/printtitle@v3 
</span><span>with: 
</span><span>title: $
</span></code></pre><p>Or bind the value to an intermediate environment variable:</p> <pre><code class="hljs"><span>env: 
</span><span>PR_TITLE: $
</span><span>run: | 
</span><span>echo “$PR_TITLE” 
</span></code></pre><p>Use <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect"><strong>OIDC</strong></a> and respective Secrets Manager for access to cloud providers instead of using secrets.
Use <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions"><strong>GitHub Secrets</strong></a> to store keys securely and reference in workflows using <code class="hljs inline no-lang">${{}}</code>.
