### Pre-Semester Progress

Before the semester started, I made a release of RepoSense v2.5. I was mainly involved in guiding the NUS-ISC 
contributors and reviewing PRs for the FYP project. I also created issues and helped to manage the labels and milestones
in the issue tracker.

### CS3282 Semester Progress

During the semester, I was actively involved in mentoring the CS3281 students and guiding them in their PRs. I met with CS3281 students atleast biweekly to discuss their progress and help them with their issues. I also reviewed their PRs and provided guidance on picking up management tasks in the project. Lastly, I merged PRs and helped to manage the project's issue tracker.
