I suspect this has to do with how tables work in HTML, which is that they are essentially not really a single element but actually split into multiple table cell elements; this is unlike table rows which are single row elements. This means that Angular Material drag and drop probably works pretty well with rows, adding animations/previews. Unfortunately, this is not the case with columns.
