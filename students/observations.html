Conventional commits allowed for projects with a large developer base to have visibility and transparency over who did what, when. Furthermore, the standardisation allows for easy automatic changelog generation, important for when products are shipped out to actual users; as well as making it easier for people to contribute to projects.</p> <p data-v-6607c59e>FerretDB suffered from the lack of implementation of Conventional Commits: without it, it was dependent on the platform (GitHub) the repository was hosted on to actually generate meaningful Changelogs. This added additional dependencies that tied the project with GitHub unnecessarily, instead of allowing the project to be independent of the Git versioning platform it was hosted on (GitLab, BitBucket are suitable alternatives).</p> <p data-v-6607c59e>As such, Changelog generation was originally done by using the GitHub workflow directly, which overly complicated the release process, necessitating for another way to locally generate the Changelog.</p></div></div> <!----></div></div></div> <div class="alert box-container alert-default" data-v-6607c59e><!----> <div class="header-and-body" data-v-6607c59e><!----> <div class="box-body-wrapper" data-v-6607c59e><!----> <!----> <div class="contents" data-v-6607c59e><h2 id="wong-chee-hong" data-v-6607c59e>WONG CHEE HONG<a href="#wong-chee-hong" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-6607c59e></a></h2> <div data-v-6607c59e><h3 id="project-sourceacademy-frontend" data-v-6607c59e>Project: SourceAcademy Frontend<a href="#project-sourceacademy-frontend" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-6607c59e></a></h3> <p data-v-6607c59e>Sourceacademy is the an online experiential environment used for teaching students computational thinking and is used by the School of Computing in NUS and Uppsala University in Sweden to teach introductory programming modules.

In Sourceacademy, I have seen how Redux and Redux Toolkit was used to create a typesafe global state that is shared across the entire application and I appreciate how well structured the code was in the repository.</p> <p data-v-6607c59e><strong data-v-6607c59e>i18next</strong></p> <p data-v-6607c59e>i18next is a library that allows for internationalization in a React project. It is a powerful library that allows for easy translation of text in a project. During my implementation of the i18n framework in Sourceacademy, I referenced several implementations of i18n across various established open source repos such as HospitalRun and FreeCodeCamp for any best practices. From these references, I learned how to structure the i18n files and the various translation resources to make it easy for future translators to add on new translations.</p> <p data-v-6607c59e>Furthermore, the i18n framework that I contributed to has strong type safety and only allows keys that are defined in the translation files to be used, making it easier for future developers to see what keys are allowed on what file. I am grateful for the Sourceacademy maintainers for their guidance in this implementation.</p> <p data-v-6607c59e><strong data-v-6607c59e>Practices and tools from SourceAcademy that could be adopted by CATcher</strong></p> <p data-v-6607c59e>SourceAcademy utilises Yarn as their package manager. From almost all points of view, yarn has the exact same functionality as npm, but it is faster and more reliable. As such, we could consider moving over to using Yarn in CATcher as well.</p> <p data-v-6607c59e>Furthermore, I was particularly impressed with the testing framework that they had to ensure any new changes were not breaking. They made use of jest and had an interactive UI test runner that allowed the developer to see which tests were failing and why. This is something that CATcher could consider adopting as well.</p></div></div> <!----></div></div></div> <h1 id="markbind">MarkBind<a href="#markbind" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor"></a></h1> <div class="alert box-container alert-default" data-v-6607c59e><!----> <div class="header-and-body" data-v-6607c59e><!----> <div class="box-body-wrapper" data-v-6607c59e><!----> <!----> <div class="contents" data-v-6607c59e><h2 id="chan-yu-cheng" data-v-6607c59e>CHAN YU CHENG<a href="#chan-yu-cheng" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-6607c59e></a></h2> <div data-v-6607c59e><h3 id="project-foo-2" data-v-6607c59e>Project: Foo<a href="#project-foo-2" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-6607c59e></a></h3> <p data-v-6607c59e>Give an intro to the project here ...</p> <h3 id="my-contributions-7" data-v-6607c59e>My Contributions<a href="#my-contributions-7" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-6607c59e></a></h3> <p data-v-6607c59e>Give a description of your contributions, including links to relevant PRs</p> <h3 id="my-learning-record-7" data-v-6607c59e>My Learning Record<a href="#my-learning-record-7" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-6607c59e></a></h3> <p data-v-6607c59e>Give tools/technologies you learned here.

Although the library had amazing loader designs, it used Node 12 and could not be utilized in modern projects using Next.js, which has a minimum Node requirement of Node 18. I successfully updated the node version in the project and used <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-6607c59e>ncu</code> or <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-6607c59e>npm-check-updates</code> to update old dependencies in <a href="https://github.com/ashutosh1919/react-awesome-loaders/pull/24" data-v-6607c59e>PR#24</a>. Unfortunately, the documentation site could not be updated to Node 18 as it was created with <a href="https://github.com/gregberge/smooth-doc" data-v-6607c59e>smooth-doc</a>, which was not compatible with Node 18. Considering that I needed to migrate the entire documentation site to a new framework, I put the PR on hold and it was not merged.</p> <p data-v-6607c59e><strong data-v-6607c59e>checkstyle</strong></p> <p data-v-6607c59e>Then I tried my hand at <a href="https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle" data-v-6607c59e>checkstyle</a>, a Java static code analysis tool, in Jan 2024. I removed //ok comments for the equalavoidsnull module in <a href="https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/pull/14215" data-v-6607c59e>PR#14215</a> and the PR was merged. The project maintainers were responsive and the issues for new contributors were handpicked by maintainers and labelled as &quot;good first issue&quot;, &quot;good second issue&quot;, &quot;good third issue&quot; and &quot;good fourth issue&quot; (1 - 3 each). This facilitated easy identification of issues for new contributors and progression through the contribution process.</p> <h3 id="my-learning-record-11" data-v-6607c59e>My Learning Record<a href="#my-learning-record-11" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-6607c59e></a></h3> <h4 id="1-tools-and-technologies" data-v-6607c59e>1.

I discovered that date-fns utilizes tree-shaking to reduce the size of the final bundle and read the <a href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/" data-v-6607c59e>webpack documentation</a> to understand its functionality. Tree shaking involves dead code elimination to ensure production-ready code with minimal file size, allowing compatibility with tools like webpack, Rollup, etc.</p> <p data-v-6607c59e>The project also employs a function-based API where each function is a pure function, enabling better immutability and testability. Moreover, it allows for importing only the necessary functions, enhancing performance. Additionally, the project offers a functional-programming submodule facilitating improved function composition, which allowed revisiting some concepts taught in CS1101S.</p> <p data-v-6607c59e><strong data-v-6607c59e>1.2 Testing npm packages</strong></p> <p data-v-6607c59e>Since I worked on an npm package, I learned various methods to test npm packages locally beyond standard unit testing. Instead of repeatedly publishing the package to npm (which I would have done a year ago -_-), I utilized <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-6607c59e>npm link</code> to test the package locally in other JavaScript projects. I learned about this approach from <a href="https://urre.me/writings/test-local-npm-packages/" data-v-6607c59e>Urban Sanden's blog</a>. Additionally, I used <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-6607c59e>npm tsx</code> to get a TypeScript REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop) and required the respective date-fns function to test them within the terminal. This was facilitated by <a href="https://tsx.is/" data-v-6607c59e>tsx</a>, which stands for TypeScript Execute, and enables running TypeScript in Node.js with improved Developer Experience (watch mode, scripts, etc).</p> <p data-v-6607c59e><strong data-v-6607c59e>1.3 Generating documentation</strong></p> <p data-v-6607c59e>date-fns uses TypeDoc to generate documentation for the project. I used <a href="https://typedoc.org/guides/overview/" data-v-6607c59e>the official TypeDoc docs</a> to understand its functionality. The documentation site generator created documentation based on the TSDoc comments deployed on Firebase. The TSDoc standard was used for documenting the code, akin to JavaDoc. Having worked with multiple TypeScript projects before, this was my first experience using a TypeScript documentation generator, and it was smooth.</p> <p data-v-6607c59e><strong data-v-6607c59e>1.4 Date manipulation in JavaScript</strong></p> <p data-v-6607c59e>Exploring the history of <a href="https://medium.com/@vitorbritto/mastering-date-an-time-in-javascript-a4c12501aa6a" data-v-6607c59e>date manipulation in JavaScript</a> and its evolution over time was enlightening. I learned about various methods for date manipulation in JavaScript and compared date-fns with competing libraries like <a href="https://momentjs.com/" data-v-6607c59e>Moment.js</a> and <a href="https://day.js.org/" data-v-6607c59e>Day.js</a>.</p> <p data-v-6607c59e>Additionally, considering date-fns aims to improve Duration support, I explored the experimental ECMAScript <a href="https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/duration.html" data-v-6607c59e>Temporal proposal</a> that seeks to provide native support for Durations in JavaScript. This proposal could potentially enhance duration functions without using our library, however, polyfills like these tend to be heavy, prompting date-fns to implement a lightweight solution as an interim API with a minimal subset of the Temporal proposal.</p> <h4 id="2-reflections-on-contributing-to-date-fns" data-v-6607c59e>2. Reflections on contributing to date-fns<a href="#2-reflections-on-contributing-to-date-fns" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-6607c59e></a></h4> <p data-v-6607c59e>date-fns has a <a href="https://date-fns.org/docs/Contributing" data-v-6607c59e>Contributing Guide</a> detailing how to contribute to the project.</p> <p data-v-6607c59e><strong data-v-6607c59e>2.1 Good: No more &quot;Move fast and break things&quot;</strong></p> <p data-v-6607c59e>Having worked in fast-paced environments before, I generally embrace the &quot;move fast and break things&quot; mentality (maybe a bit too much :3 -&gt; RepoSense issues <a href="https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/issues/2164" data-v-6607c59e>#2164</a> and <a href="https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/issues/2184" data-v-6607c59e>#2184</a>). However, you do not have that &quot;freedom&quot; when working on an npm package with 20 million weekly downloads. This was a good learning experience for me as even a simple function such as <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-6607c59e>parseISODuration</code> required extensive discussions regarding design decisions, for example, whether undefined values should be preserved, what rules should be followed for parsing, etc., and all these should consider the standard proposals, the competitor libraries' features, and the community's feedback.</p> <p data-v-6607c59e><strong data-v-6607c59e>2.2 Good: Making a difference</strong></p> <p data-v-6607c59e>While many other OSS projects I contributed to involved fixing bugs or adding small features, date-fns was more about making a difference. Since date-fns is a modular library with pure functions, contributors get to work on actual features that can be used by millions of developers worldwide. This was a great motivation for me to contribute to date-fns.</p> <p data-v-6607c59e><strong data-v-6607c59e>2.3 Good: Targeted mentorship</strong></p> <p data-v-6607c59e>I reached out to the maintainers of date-fns and they were very helpful in guiding me on how to contribute to the project. This helped me work on the project for a longer period of time and make more meaningful contributions based on the project's needs instead of randomly picking issues to work on.</p> <p data-v-6607c59e><strong data-v-6607c59e>2.4 To improve: Community management</strong></p> <p data-v-6607c59e>date-fns has a large community and a lot of issues are opened every day. However, the 3-5 maintainers of the project do not have the bandwidth to manage all the issues. This makes it difficult for new contributors to find issues to work on. Moreover, repetitive issues are opened multiple times, leading to duplicated efforts in PRs. This is something that can be improved in date-fns.</p> <p data-v-6607c59e>Since there are too many PRs opened, the maintainers have decided to only focus on those PRs that contribute towards the project's long-term goals, which is a good strategy to ensure that the project is moving in the right direction. Sometimes, contributors are not responsive to maintainers' feedback and this leads to abandoned PRs. Instead of starting from scratch, I learned how to handle abandoned PRs by taking over one and completing the work.</p> <p data-v-6607c59e><strong data-v-6607c59e>2.5 To improve: Documentation contrasts</strong></p> <p data-v-6607c59e>While date-fns has a very comprehensive documentation website, the <a href="https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns.org" data-v-6607c59e>documentation website generator</a> did not have any contribution guidelines, because it was mainly handled by the core team. This made it difficult for me to understand how to contribute to the custom documentation website generator, and I had to reach out to the maintainers for guidance. This is understandable as the documentation site generator does not expect much community contributions, but is still something that can be improved in date-fns.</p> <h4 id="3-suggestions-for-reposense" data-v-6607c59e>3. Suggestions for RepoSense<a href="#3-suggestions-for-reposense" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-6607c59e></a></h4> <p data-v-6607c59e><strong data-v-6607c59e>3.1 One-to-one mentorship</strong></p> <p data-v-6607c59e>date-fns has a system where maintainers provide weekly advice to contributors to help them make meaningful contributions to the project. This is a great way to guide new contributors and help them understand the project better. This is something that can be adopted by RepoSense to help new contributors make contributions that align with project goals.</p> <p data-v-6607c59e><strong data-v-6607c59e>3.2 Automatic documentation generation</strong></p> <p data-v-6607c59e>Looking at the custom documentation generator for date-fns got me thinking about whether there is a way to automatically generate documentation for RepoSense, especially for the CLI arguments and the configuration files. This would help new contributors understand the project better and also assist in maintaining up-to-date documentation. Although the work required to set up the documentation generator might be substantial, it could prove to be a worthwhile investment in the long run, particularly if well-documented.</p> <p data-v-6607c59e><strong data-v-6607c59e>3.3 New contributor issues</strong></p> <p data-v-6607c59e>If we aim to attract more first-time contributors to NUS-OSS projects as opposed to long-term contributors, we could establish a system akin to checkstyle's approach by labelling issues as &quot;good first issue,&quot; &quot;good second issue,&quot; and so on. By doing this, RepoSense can streamline the onboarding process and foster a welcoming community for a diverse pool of contributors. This would also help in managing the influx of new contributors and ensure that they have a smooth onboarding experience.</p></div></div> <!----></div></div></div> <div class="alert box-container alert-default" data-v-6607c59e><!----> <div class="header-and-body" data-v-6607c59e><!----> <div class="box-body-wrapper" data-v-6607c59e><!----> <!----> <div class="contents" data-v-6607c59e><h2 id="david-gareth-ong" data-v-6607c59e>DAVID GARETH ONG<a href="#david-gareth-ong" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-6607c59e></a></h2> <div data-v-6607c59e><h3 id="project-recharts" data-v-6607c59e>Project: Recharts<a href="#project-recharts" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-6607c59e></a></h3> <p data-v-6607c59e><a href="https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/issues" data-v-6607c59e>Recharts</a> is a React library that provides an easy way to write &amp; render charts in React applications.</p> <h3 id="my-contributions-12" data-v-6607c59e>My Contributions<a href="#my-contributions-12" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-6607c59e></a></h3> <p data-v-6607c59e>My first contribution was updating the <a href="https://storybook.js.org/" data-v-6607c59e>Storybook</a> page of the project. Storybook is a frontend workshop that allows users to render UI components and/or pages in isolation, and is often used for interactive documentation of each component in UI libraries. Within Recharts, in addition to the standard markdown-based documentation of its components, it maintains a Storybook page that documents each component interactively, as well as providing examples of how to achieve common use-cases with the components it provides.</p> <p data-v-6607c59e>In <a href="https://github.com/recharts/recharts/pull/4339" data-v-6607c59e>docs: add storybook example for line trailing icon in LineChart</a>, I added an example of how to add a custom trailing icon to a line within a line chart, which was a common usecase that required a workaround.</p> <h3 id="my-learning-record-12" data-v-6607c59e>My Learning Record<a href="#my-learning-record-12" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-6607c59e></a></h3> <p data-v-6607c59e>The observed workflow/process of this external project has a couple of extremely important differences to our internal project (RepoSense in particular), which I feel we can learn from to improve developer experience, reduce the likelihood of regressions, and speed up turnaround time.</p> <h4 id="usage-of-git-hooks" data-v-6607c59e>Usage of git hooks<a href="#usage-of-git-hooks" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-6607c59e></a></h4> <p data-v-6607c59e>The project has set up automatic hooks (using <a href="https://github.com/typicode/husky" data-v-6607c59e>Husky</a>) that run before every <a href="https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/3.x/.husky/pre-commit" data-v-6607c59e>commit</a> and <a href="https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/3.x/.husky/pre-push" data-v-6607c59e>push</a>. These hooks run the linter and automated tests, and prevent any user from pushing if the linter and/or tests fail. What this does is guarantee that by the time a pull request is open, there won't exist any lint or test errors. It is a very common occurence in RepoSense that a contributor will open a pull request, and only then be notified that their code has a bunch of lint errors (this is even more common in frontend PRs). The most likely reason for this is that the linter script in the frontend folder (<code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-6607c59e>npm run lint</code>) is never run during self testing, resulting in newer contributors almost always not being aware of the presence of the lint checks until the first time they open a PR and the CI runs. We can potentially save a lot of headache by implementing automatic git hooks into RepoSense, at least for linting the frontend codebase at a minimum. This would also probably speed up turnaround/development time, since there usually is quite a lot of time wasted when reviewers have to ask contributors to fix their linting errors.</p> <h4 id="snapshot-testing" data-v-6607c59e>Snapshot testing<a href="#snapshot-testing" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-6607c59e></a></h4> <p data-v-6607c59e>The project also utilizes snapshot testing in their automated tests.

Snapshot testing involves the automatic creation of snapshot files that stores the output at the time the tests were run, and compares future outputs to these refefrence values. The snapshot files are usually checked into version control, and can be examined alongside code changes. Here's an example of a <a href="https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/3.x/test/cartesian/__snapshots__/ReferenceArea.spec.tsx.snap" data-v-6607c59e>snapshot file</a> and <a href="https://github.com/recharts/recharts/blob/3.x/test/cartesian/ReferenceArea.spec.tsx#L375" data-v-6607c59e>snapshot check</a> in the external project's codebase.

The language also allows for strong editor tooling that also helps improve the developer experience.

Pandoc has lofty goals of providing good document conversion from a large number of input formats to a really large number of output formats. This is done by converting to and from Pandoc's own document intermediate representation, which has a large subset of the intersection of features of the input and output formats. By being very clear about the extent and specification of the intermediate representation, it is easy for several developers to concurrently add, modify, and fix existing readers and writers by mapping the semantics of the source or target specification to those of the Pandoc intermediate representation. In general, being very clear and thorough with interfaces between software segments seems to be an important and crucial aspect of any sufficiently sophisticated system. To a first approximation, Pandoc does a really good job of picking good defaults for the output format; if users want additional customizability, they can have that by writing their own custom Lua filters.</p> <h4 id="observations-from-contribution-process" data-v-6607c59e>Observations from contribution process<a href="#observations-from-contribution-process" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-6607c59e></a></h4> <p data-v-6607c59e>Great practices:</p> <ul data-v-6607c59e><li data-v-6607c59e>The maintainer, John MacFarlane (a philosophy professor at Berkeley), and other core maintainers are incredibly active.

They may continue to use that version for their projects even when much newer Python versions are released. Thus, the Python team needs to continue to support older versions (up to a limit) by making sure that bug fixes, and security patches are also made to the supported older Python versions.</p> <p data-v-6607c59e>Each version is maintained on their own respective Git branch, but all changes are initially made by submitting a PR to the main branch. The PRs are given labels like <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-6607c59e>needs backport to 3.12</code> which indicate whether the PR needs to be backported to a specific Git branch for a Python version. When a PR is merged into the main branch, a bot (<a href="https://github.com/apps/miss-islington-app" data-v-6607c59e>miss-islington-app</a>) backports it to older Python branches according to the labels.

Fixes may be made to the main branch that are also required on the feature branches. In TEAMMATES, we often integrate these fixes into the feature branches by manually rebasing the feature branch onto the last commit on the main branch or merging the main branch into the feature branch. In other words, unlike in the Python project where changes in the main branch are almost automatically integrated into the other branches, in TEAMMATES, these changes to the main branch are manually integrated into other branches.</p> <h4 id="suggestions-for-the-internal-project-based-on-external-project-observations-2" data-v-6607c59e>Suggestions for the internal project based on external project observations<a href="#suggestions-for-the-internal-project-based-on-external-project-observations-2" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-6607c59e></a></h4> <h5 id="changelog-with-highlights" data-v-6607c59e>Changelog with highlights<a href="#changelog-with-highlights" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-6607c59e></a></h5> <p data-v-6607c59e>Instead of displaying all the changes equally, it may be better to highlight some of them, as they be more significant to more users.

Maybe a bot can do this for us. A problem I can foresee with this is if there are merge conflicts. However, it is possible to make a PR for merging branches. The merge conflicts may be resolved manually in the branch created for the PR. While this reintroduces some manual work, the merge conflicts should not occur all the time. If this automation is possible, with some of the changes in the main branch being integrated into the feature branches automatically, this may reduce some of the load on the developers.</p></div></div> <!----></div></div></div> <div class="alert box-container alert-default" data-v-6607c59e><!----> <div class="header-and-body" data-v-6607c59e><!----> <div class="box-body-wrapper" data-v-6607c59e><!----> <!----> <div class="contents" data-v-6607c59e><h2 id="kevin-foong-wei-tong" data-v-6607c59e>KEVIN FOONG WEI TONG<a href="#kevin-foong-wei-tong" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-6607c59e></a></h2> <div data-v-6607c59e><h3 id="project-scribe-ios" data-v-6607c59e>Project: Scribe iOS<a href="#project-scribe-ios" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-6607c59e></a></h3> <p data-v-6607c59e><a href="https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS" data-v-6607c59e>Scribe-iOS</a> is a pack of iOS keyboards for language learners.

To solve this issue (PR <a href="https://github.com/FreezingMoon/AncientBeast/pull/2567" data-v-6607c59e>here</a> and still ongoing), I had to add the unit abilities to the assets, and then add an 'ability' class to the hovered hex's overlay visual state, removing the class as necessary. Then, I checked if the 'ability' class was present, got the appropriate ability asset, and set it to be shown above the hexagon.

I plan to complete it during the exam weeks.</p> <p data-v-6607c59e>Afterwards, I plan to take on this <a href="https://github.com/FreezingMoon/AncientBeast/issues/2539" data-v-6607c59e>third issue</a> after the PR above is merged, as it is makes use of the changes made in the above 2 PRs.</p> <h3 id="my-learning-record-22" data-v-6607c59e>My Learning Record<a href="#my-learning-record-22" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-6607c59e></a></h3> <p data-v-6607c59e>AncientBeast makes use of <a href="https://phaser.io/" data-v-6607c59e>Phaser</a> as its game engine (which is also <a href="https://github.com/phaserjs/phaser/tree/v3.80.1" data-v-6607c59e>open source</a>). Having had not much experience with game development, I found using Phaser quite challenging, and had to rely a lot on community help. I mainly learnt about how to manipulate GameObjects, such as Sprites, in Phaser as well as how they are animated and rendered.</p> <p data-v-6607c59e>Another thing I learnt about was testing a game's UI using Jest. The approach AncientBeast took relied mostly on getting game objects at certain <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-6607c59e>x</code> and <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-6607c59e>y</code> positions, as well as checking what existed at certain coordinates to ensure that actions were correctly handled. Some of the difficulties faced were in trying not to have tests depend too much on implementation (e.g. of Creatures in the game), and so tests had to be a bit more general.</p> <p data-v-6607c59e>More broadly, I learnt about game development in general. There is a lot more attention paid to anything that the user might try to do, including just hovering over something. I think this level of detail to user actions (and how it can be handled neatly in the codebase) is quite unique to game development.</p> <h3 id="observations-from-ancientbeast" data-v-6607c59e>Observations from AncientBeast<a href="#observations-from-ancientbeast" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-6607c59e></a></h3> <p data-v-6607c59e>Unfortunately, I think AncientBeast's code is quite messy. The files are long, variables are sometimes inappropriately named (e.g. some are just named <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-6607c59e>o</code>), and basically a lot of functionality is packed together in one place, reducing readability. There are deprecated calls as well, which I think should be fixed together with the deprecation. Furthermore, there is a lack of developer documentation, which further poses a challenge to new contributors. For example, I think I would have greatly benefitted from some flows of standard actions, or generally how classes interact with each other. Better documentation might also lead to better structuring of code, which AncientBeast needs. Another point of improvement would be type safety, since I found that quite a few variables are just typed as <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-6607c59e>any</code>.</p> <p data-v-6607c59e>That being said, I think AncientBeast does well in contributor management. Once someone expresses an interest in an issue, they will be assigned it and given a soft deadline, usually of 2 weeks. If they cannot complete it and/or are unresponsive, then the issue will usually be assigned to someone else, or just left without an assignee, indicating that it is available. I think we could benefit from implementing a similar approach, else our issues get inundated with &quot;is this issue still available?&quot; comments and waiting for people to say whether or not they are still working on it. The soft deadline also helps to push progress along.</p> <p data-v-6607c59e>Another thing we could adopt is having a standardised code format. I've noticed many discrepancies in coding style throughout our codebase, and I think having a standardised coding style (with non-controversial rules) would make our code neater and in some cases more readable.</p></div></div> <!----></div></div></div> <div class="alert box-container alert-default" data-v-6607c59e><!----> <div class="header-and-body" data-v-6607c59e><!----> <div class="box-body-wrapper" data-v-6607c59e><!----> <!----> <div class="contents" data-v-6607c59e><h2 id="ong-jun-heng-cedric" data-v-6607c59e>ONG JUN HENG, CEDRIC<a href="#ong-jun-heng-cedric" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-6607c59e></a></h2> <div data-v-6607c59e><h3 id="project-mattermost" data-v-6607c59e>Project: Mattermost<a href="#project-mattermost" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-6607c59e></a></h3> <p data-v-6607c59e><a href="https://mattermost.com" data-v-6607c59e>Mattermost</a> is an open-source alternative to slack and mircosoft teams, used by notable companies such as Samsung, NASA, DuckDuckGo.

To solve this, I edited the styling of the button, changing its opacity for when its disabled.
I then replicated the issue locally to add a screenshot to my PR.</p> <p data-v-6607c59e>The second was removal of a feature flag: <a href="https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-mobile/pull/7769" data-v-6607c59e>link</a>, to enable timezone support permanently in the application.
To tackle this issue, I had to look at every location where there the feature flag was used in the codebase. When removing the flag, I had to make sure that the logic was correct, behaving as if the feature flag was <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-6607c59e>true</code> and that irrelevant code was removed.</p> <h3 id="my-learning-record-23" data-v-6607c59e>My Learning Record<a href="#my-learning-record-23" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-6607c59e></a></h3> <h4 id="react-native" data-v-6607c59e>React Native<a href="#react-native" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-6607c59e></a></h4> <p data-v-6607c59e>The technology used in Mattermost's mobile application is React Native. React Native is a framework for building mobile applications using Javascript and React, and allows developers to create cross-platform applications for iOS and android using a single codebase. React Native utilizes native components and APIs, providing a user experience similar to native apps.</p> <p data-v-6607c59e>I used React Native's <a href="https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started" data-v-6607c59e>documentation</a> to learn more about it while contributing.</p> <h3 id="observations-from-mattermost" data-v-6607c59e>Observations from Mattermost<a href="#observations-from-mattermost" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-6607c59e></a></h3> <ul data-v-6607c59e><li data-v-6607c59e>PRs are reviewed extensively, with clear steps. Each step is labelled clearly. (Dev Review, QA review, PM review) TEAMMATES also has a similar system in place in terms of labelling the stage of a PR review.</li> <li data-v-6607c59e>Issues are labelled with the technology required (e.g. React, ReactNative, go), the difficulty level (from 1-4), and whether it is currently being worked on by someone. This makes it easier for potential contributors to select issues based on their own confidence level. In TEAMMATES, we only have <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-6607c59e>good first issue</code> as any indicator of difficulty level, but given that most difficult issues are handled by the internal team, there is unlikely a need for difficulty level. For technology required, TEAMMATES also does not have a label, but it should be quite clear when reading the issue if it requires Backend or Frontend. TEAMMATES also has a <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-6607c59e>a-UIX</code> tag that is meant for UIUX related issues, which is very often used to tag Frontend issues.</li> <li data-v-6607c59e>Mattermost also has their own deployed instance of itself, where contributors can ask questions. It was really useful for me when I ran into issues trying to login to my locally setup Mattermost, and asking for PR reviews.

For very simple and small changes required, we can create a hook that can apply changes / suggestions from reviewers.
Although we do hope for new contributors to get this chance to learn about teammates' coding practices, in other instances and for minor nits: it can significantly speed up time taken to merge in PRs if the author does not need to manually make the changes in their branch and push again.
