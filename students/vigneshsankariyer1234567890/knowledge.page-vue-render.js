Instead, Angular uses a Change Detection Strategy which can be configured by the user (either onPush or Default). Angular Change Detection works by using Zone.js and activating after every async action performed. CD traversal starts at the root component (usually App) and works its way down the component tree updating the DOM as needed. What's happening under the hood is that browser events are registered into Zone.js - Angular's mechanism for orchestrating async events - which emits changes after initial template bindings are created.\n...")])])}
